A Prospective Research Study to Investigate the Impact of Complementary Therapies on Patient Well-being in Palliative Care	Complementary therapies are being used more in the UK over the last two decades and yet very little evidence of their benefit is available. The aim of this study was to  investigate, through face to face interviews with patients, using a phenomenlogical approach the perceived benefits of the different therapies in terms of their overall patient well-being. Eight patients; mean age 52.87 years, range 40-64 years presenting in the palliative care phase for life limiting conditions comprising one male and seven females agreed to participate in the study between March and September 2015. All eight participants reported perceived benefited from the therapies and that their identified concerns had been ameliorated. Participants reported feeling relaxed, calmer and being able to carry on with their daily lives and refocussing on themselves and what is important in life. Complementary therapies played a positive role, and therefore, an acceptable model of supporting palliative  care patients.	well-being
Mapping of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in Rivers From Very High Resolution Image Data, Using Object Based Image Analysis Combined with Expert Knowledge	The use of remote sensing for monitoring of submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) in fluvial environments has been limited by the spatial and spectral resolution of available image data. The absorption of light in water also complicates the use of common image analysis methods. This paper presents the results of a study that uses very high resolution (VHR) image data, collected with a Near Infrared sensitive DSLR camera, to map the distribution of SAV species for three sites along the Desselse Nete, a lowland river in Flanders, Belgium. Plant species, including Ranunculus aquatilis L., Callitriche obtusangula Le Gall, Potamogeton natans L., Sparganium emersum L. and Potamogeton crispus L., were classified from the data using Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) and expert knowledge. A classification rule set based on a combination of both spectral and structural image variation (e.g. texture and shape) was developed for images from two sites. A comparison of the classifications with manually delineated ground truth maps resulted for both sites in 61% overall accuracy. Application of the rule set to a third validation image, resulted in 53% overall accuracy. These consistent results show promise for species level mapping in such biodiverse environments, but also prompt a discussion on assessment of classification accuracy.	water
Midwives Understanding of Physical Activity Guidelines During Pregnancy	Objective to examine the current level of understanding held by midwives regarding the NICE physical activity guidelines in the UK, and to investigate the physical activity guidance given to women during pregnancy. Design an 11 question online survey comprising of a mixture of closed and open ended questions. Setting data reflects participants sampled across the United Kingdom. Participants fifty-nine midwives completed the online survey Measurements and findings an electronic survey was used to explore the midwives understanding of physical activity guidelines during pregnancy, and the advice they offered to women in their care. Qualitative content analysis was used to gain a more in-depth understanding of midwife knowledge. Two per cent of midwives correctly identified the physical activity guidelines, with 44 giving partially correct responses, 25 giving incorrect responses and 29 unsure of what the guidelines are. Despite the low level of correct responses, 59 of respondents reported they were confident or very confident in answering questions regarding physical activity. Only 4 of respondents reported having access to continual professional development (CPD) in the area of PA guidance. Key conclusions there appears to be a misplaced confidence amongst midwives in their knowledge of the NICE PA guidelines for pregnancy. Implications for practice as physical inactivity can be detrimental for the health of both mother and baby, there is a clear need for better dissemination of the current and future NICE physical activity guidelines in primary health care settings. The current study determined a substantial lack of CPD in the area of PA guidance, which may be a contributing factor to the lack of knowledge of the guidelines. As such, increasing CPD may in turn improve the accuracy of the advice given to pregnant women and consequently benefit the health of both mother and baby. Â© 2018 Elsevier Ltd	women
The Detection and Policing of Gun Crime: Challenges to the Effective Policing of Gun Crime in Europe	Despite a shared understanding across the EU that access to firearms by the general public should be restricted, detailed legislation regarding the ownership, use and trade of firearms varies between EU member states. It is unclear however, how such variations impact on the policing of gun enabled crime. By using qualitative data generated from interviews with police, policy and decision makers from thirteen European countries, the authors of this article aim to determine how stakeholders perceive that national variations in firearms legislation impact on the policing of gun enabled crime within and across EU countries. Four main themes were identified from the qualitative data: disparities in Legislation, disparities in Priority given and the Resources allocated to investigations into gun enabled crime as well as  Interventions. Due to the aforementioned disparities, cross-national investigations into incidents of gun crime are at risk of remaining impaired in their effectiveness. Therefore, more legislative coherency as well as sustainable long-term interventions will be needed to  successfully reduce ownership and use of firearms in the criminal world. In this context, a departure from an exclusive use of an economic model of gun crime is recommended to allow for a better understanding of the dynamics of the black gun market.	sustainable
Phase-based Treatment Versus Immediate Trauma-focused Treatment in Patients with Childhood Trauma-related Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Study Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial	The treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) related to a history of sexual and/or physical abuse in childhood is the subject of international debate, with some favouring a phase-based approach as their preferred treatment, while others argue for immediate trauma-focused treatment. A history of (chronic) traumatisation during childhood has been linked to the development of distinct symptoms that are often labelled as symptoms of complex PTSD. Many therapists associate the presence of symptoms of complex PTSD with a less favourable treatment prognosis. The purpose of this study is to determine whether a phase-based approach is more effective than stand-alone trauma-focused therapy in individuals with PTSD and possible symptoms of complex PTSD resulting from a history of repeated sexual and/or physical abuse in childhood. An additional aim is to investigate moderators, predictors of treatment (non) response and drop-out. The sample consists of patients between 18 and 65 years old with a diagnosis of PTSD who report a history of repeated sexual and/or physical abuse in childhood (N = 122). Patients will be blindly allocated to either 16 sessions of eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy preceded by a stabilization phase (eight sessions of Skills Training in Affect and Interpersonal Regulation (STAIR)) or only 16 sessions of EMDR therapy. Assessments are carried out pre-treatment, after every eighth session, post-treatment, and at 3 and 6 months follow up. The main parameter will be the severity of PTSD symptoms (PTSD Symptoms Scale-Self Report). Secondary outcome variables are the presence of a PTSD diagnosis (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5), severity of complex PTSD symptoms (Structured Interview for Disorders of Extreme Stress-Revised and symptoms-specific questionnaires), changes in symptoms of general psychopathology (Brief Symptom Inventory), and quality of life (Euroqol-5D). Health care consumption and productivity loss in patients will also be indexed. The study results may help to inform the ongoing debate about whether a phase-based approach has added value over immediate trauma-focused therapy in patients suffering from PTSD due to childhood abuse. Furthermore, the results will contribute to knowledge about the safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness of treatments in this target group. Nederlands Trialregister, NTR5991 .

Talking Heresy About ‘Quality’ Early Childhood Education and Care for Children in Poverty	This paper considers the socially progressive function of a model of 'quality' early childhood education and care widely prescribed to address child poverty across England and the USA. Ubiquitous, it is imbued with a sense of objectivity, secureness and practicality. We question these foundations. Then using data from practitioners in both countries, we contrast expectations about this model of ECEC as an unmitigated good building resilience to 'break cycles of disadvantage', with the everyday experiences and frustrations of practitioners pursuing it. Their data suggest this model of 'quality' has limitations and some heresy is required about this policy orthodoxy.	poverty
Community Heterogeneity of Aquatic Macroinvertebrates in Urban Ponds at a Multi-city Scale	Purpose  Urbanisation is a leading cause of biotic homogenisation in urban ecosystems. However, there has been little research examining the effect of urbanisation and biotic homogenisation on aquatic communities, and few studies have compared findings across different urban landscapes. We assessed the processes that structure aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity within five UK urban settlements and characterise the heterogeneity of pond macroinvertebrate communities within and among urban areas.  Methods  A total of 132 ponds were sampled for invertebrates to characterise biological communities of ponds across five UK cities. Variation among sites within cities, and variation among cities, was partitioned into components of beta diversity relating to turnover and nestedness.  Results  We recorded 337 macroinvertebrate taxa, and species turnover almost entirely accounted for the high beta-diversity recorded within each urban area and when all ponds were considered. A total of 40% of all macroinvertebrates recorded were unique to a particular urban settlement. In contrast to the homogenisation of terrestrial and lotic communities in urban landscapes reported in the literature, ponds support highly heterogeneous communities within and among urban settlements.  Conclusions  The high species turnover (species replacement) recorded in this study demonstrates that urban pond biodiversity conservation would be most efficient at a landscape-scale, rather than at individual ponds. Pond conservation practices need to consider the spatial organization of ecological communities (landscape-scale) to ensure that the maximum possible biodiversity can be protected.	cities,ecosystems
Points-based Physical Sctivity: A Novel Approach to Facilitate Changes in Body Composition in Inactive Women with Overweight and Obesity	Background: Physical activity (PA) interventions for the promotion of weight-management may benefit from  increased choice and flexibility to overcome commonly-perceived barriers to PA. The aim of this study was to  investigate the effects of a novel “points-based” approach to PA on body composition in inactive women, who  are overweight or obese.  Methods: Seventy-six overweight or obese, inactive women were randomly allocated to one of three conditions:  ‘Points-based’ PA (PBPA; 30 “PA points”•week− 1), Structured exercise (StructEx; 150 min moderate-intensity  exercise•week− 1) or control (CONT; continue habitual inactive lifestyle) for a 24-week intervention. PA points for  activities were adapted from MET values, and 30 points was equivalent to 150 min of brisk walking. Measures of  body composition (dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry) and anthropometry were obtained at weeks 0, 4, 12 and 24.  Self-report activities were recorded weekly, with objective measures of PA (tri-axial accelerometry) and self-report  measures of food intake obtained at weeks 0 and 24.  Results: Fifty-eight women completed the study and provided data for primary outcomes. Of these, n = 41 and  n = 19 provided data for food intake and objectively assessed PA. Mixed-design ANOVAs demonstrated that those  in PBPA achieved a significant weight-loss at 24 weeks of − 3.3 ± 5.9 kg (− 3.4 ± 7.1%, p = 0.004). Waist circumference  was reduced in PBPA at 24 weeks (− 2.8 ± 4.6 cm), compared with CONT (+ 2.1 ± 6.6 cm, p = 0.024). There was a trend  for greater reductions in fat mass for those in PBPA vs. CONT (− 2.3 ± 4.6 kg vs. + 0.1 ± 2.0 kg, p = 0.075). Android fat  was reduced in PBPA at both 12 weeks (− 6.1 ± 12.6%, p = 0.005) and 24 weeks (− 10.1 ± 18.4%, p = 0.005), while  there was a trend for greater reductions in visceral adipose tissue in PBPA (− 5.8 ± 26.0%) vs. CONT at  24 weeks (+ 7.8 ± 18.3%, p = 0.053). Body composition, body weight and waist circumference were unchanged  in StructEx. There were trends for increases in light-activity and reductions in sedentary time in PBPA. There  was a trend for a reduction in daily energy intake of − 445 ± 564 kcal (p = 0.074), and a significant reduction  in daily fat intake (p = 0.042) in PBPA.  Conclusion: A “points-based” approach to physical activity appears to be an effective strategy for inducing modest  reductions in body weight and body fat in inactive women with overweight and obesity.	energy,women
Mania Triggered by Sleep Loss and Risk of Postpartum Psychosis in Women with Bipolar Disorder	Background: Women with bipolar disorder are at high risk of affective psychoses following childbirth (i.e.  “postpartum psychosis”, PP) and there is a need to identify which factors underlie this increased risk.  Vulnerability to mood dysregulation following sleep loss may influence risk of PP, as childbirth is typified by  sleep disruption. We investigated whether a history of mood episodes triggered by sleep loss was associated with  PP in women with bipolar disorder (BD).  Methods: Participants were 870 parous women with BD recruited to the Bipolar Disorder Research Network.  Lifetime diagnoses of BD and perinatal episodes were identified via interview and case notes. Information on  whether mood episodes had been triggered by sleep loss was derived at interview. Rates of PP were compared  between women who did and did not report mood episodes following sleep loss.  Results: Women who reported sleep loss triggering episodes of mania were twice as likely to have experienced an episode of PP (OR = 2.09, 95% CI = 1.47–2.97, p<0.001) compared to women who did not report this. There was no significant association between depression triggered by sleep loss and PP (p = 0.526).  Limitations: Data were cross-sectional therefore may be subject to recall bias. We also did not have objective data on sleep disruption that had occurred during the postpartum period or prior to mood episodes.  Conclusions: In clinical practice, a history of mania following sleep loss could be a marker of increased vulnerability to PP, and should be discussed with BD women who are pregnant or planning to conceive.	women
Synthetic Social Support: Theorizing Lay Health Worker Interventions	Levels of social support are strongly associated with health outcomes and inequalities. The use of lay health workers (LHWs) has been suggested by policy makers across the world as an intervention to identify risks to health and to promote health, particularly in disadvantaged communities. However, there have been few attempts to theorize the work undertaken by LHWs to understand how interventions work. In this article, the authors present the concept of 'synthetic socialsupport' and distinguish it from the work of health professionals or the spontaneous social support received from friends and family. The authors provide new empirical data to illustrate the concept based on qualitative, observational research, using a novel shadowing method involving clinical and non-clinical researchers, on the everyday work of 'pregnancy outreach workers' (POWs) in Birmingham, UK. The service was being evaluated as part of a randomized controlled trial. These LHWs provided instrumental, informational, emotional and appraisal support to the women they worked with, which are all key components of social support. The social support was 'synthetic' because it was distinct from the support embedded in spontaneous social networks: it was non-reciprocal; it was offered on a strictly time-limited basis; the LHWs were accountable for the relationship, and the social networks produced were targeted rather than spontaneous. The latter two qualities of this synthetic form of social support may have benefits over spontaneous networks by improving the opportunities for the cultivation of new relationships (both strong and weak ties) outside the women's existing spontaneous networks that can have a positive impact on them and by offering a reliable source of health information and support in a chaotic environment. The concept of SSS can help inform policy makers about how deploying lay workers may enable them to achieve desired outcomes, specify their programme theories and evaluate accordingly.

Running With the Ball? Making a Play for Sport Heritage Archives in Higher Education Contexts	For considerable time, academia (in particular, the Humanities) has been in an intellectual, economic and pragmatic par des deux with the culture and arts sector (in this case, heritage, museums and archives). In many ways, given their respective pursuits of scientific enquiry and learning, valuable contribution to a knowledge economy, commitment to public enlightenment, and exploration of critical and creative endeavour, a relationship between the sectors makes sense. Unity notwithstanding, the relationships have become increasingly now influenced by (en)forced contextual constraints (e.g., government policy development and intervention, neoliberal market forces, structural and ideological shifts in funding acquisition and allocation, patronage changes and demands, and/or individual political priorities) (Dubuc 2011; McCall and Gray 2014; Watson 2002). Drawing on education and heritage scholarship, and theoretical frameworks of sport culture spaces (Hardy, Loy and Booth 2009; Phillips 2012; Pinson 2017), this paper examines efforts undertaken at one specific Higher Education establishment in the United Kingdom in which institutional agendas (vis-à-vis historical and cultural foci, encouraging ‘impactful’ academic activity, brand exposure, economic efficiency, and community engagement) have contoured, and become entwined with, an embryonic sport heritage and archive project. Recalling similar arrangements elsewhere (Krüger 2014; Reilly, Clayton and Hughson 2014; Reilly 2015), the aim of this case study is to explore how the wider education and cultural policy context have precipitated an increasingly symbiotic and dependent relationship between university and cultural/arts initiatives. The paper considers how the impetus to develop a sports-based (basketball) heritage archive and study centre reflects the current fragilities of the two sectors, yet, concomitantly, reveals the potentials that might be developed from fostering greater intellectual and pragmatic alliances. The paper concludes by advocating the practical, political and ideological usefulness of network formation, sustainability measures and continued cross-sector dialogue.	sustainability

The Subversion of Mill and the Ultimate Aim of Nursing	This is lightly edited and referenced version of a presentation given at the 20th International Philosophy of Nursing conference in Quebec on 23rd August 2016.  Philosophical texts are not given the same prominence in nurse education as their more valued younger sibling, primary research evidence, but they can influence practice through guidelines, codes and espoused values.  John Stuart Mill’s harm principle, found in On Liberty, is not a universal law, and only a thoroughgoing libertarian would defend it as such, though it, or its remnants, can be seen can be seen in policy documents. But its influence is weakening. Smoking bans in enclosed spaces were initially justified with other-regarding considerations, but judgements from unsuccessful legal challenges from patients in UK psychiatric hospitals rely on preventing harm to the smoker, even when smoking outside, which does not harm others. In the wake of legislation, no-smoking policies enacted by hospitals are becoming more aggressive, banning smoking both inside and outside, and extending the use of power gained through employment to prevent nurses assisting patients enjoy a lawful habit. Mill’s dictum has been subverted, and this speaks to the fundamental purpose of nursing.  Should nurses collude and willingly exert their power for their version of the good of the patient? Or should they instead reaffirm values that support and facilitate life choices made by autonomous people? The paper supports the latter option, and this has wider application for nursing which can be illuminated, if not settled, by revisiting Mill and his famous dictum.	employment
Reflections on Professionalism: Driving Forces that Refine and Shape Professional Practice	Early education systems in England require those who work alongside children to follow policies intended to promote quality early education and care. Their professional role is embedded into those systems and includes promoting integrated inter-professional working, safeguarding children’s welfare, supporting children to meet national early learning goals and promoting inclusive education. Their professional responsibilities include demonstrating sound pedagogical practice and a detailed developmental assessment of children. They are also asked to forge positive relationships with families and are accountable to parents and regulators. This paper provokes further thinking and exploration of these roles, responsibilities and relationships. It asks whether existing regulatory systems are the driving forces which shape professional practice and determine professionalism or if there is more to being a competent, adaptive, reflective early educator.	inclusive education
A Multicentre, Randomised Controlled Trial of Position During the Late Stages of Labour in Nulliparous Women with an Epidural: Clinical Effectiveness and an Economic Evaluation (BUMPES)	Epidural analgesia leads to increased risk of instrumental vaginal delivery (IVD). There is debate about whether or not posture in second-stage labour influences the incidence of spontaneous vaginal birth (SVB). In nulliparous women with epidural analgesia, does a policy of adopting an 'upright position' throughout second-stage labour increase the incidence of SVB compared with a policy of adopting a 'lying-down' position? Two-arm randomised controlled trial. Maternity units in England and Wales. Nulliparous women aged ≥ 16 years, at ≥ 37 weeks' gestation with singleton cephalic presentation and intended SVB, in second-stage labour with an epidural providing effective pain relief. (1) Upright position to maintain the pelvis in as vertical a plane as possible; and (2) lying-down position to maintain the pelvis in as horizontal a plane as possible. The primary outcome measure was incidence of SVB. Secondary outcomes included augmentation, interventions to maintain blood pressure, duration of labour, episiotomy, genital tract trauma, post-partum haemorrhage, maternal satisfaction, neonatal metabolic acidosis, 5-minute Apgar score of < 4, resuscitation at birth and admission to neonatal unit. At 1 year for (1) women: urinary or faecal incontinence, dyspareunia and health-related quality of life; (2) for infants: major morbidity. A cost-consequences analysis with a time horizon of 1 year after the birth from a NHS perspective. Between October 2010 and January 2014, 3236 women were randomised from 41 centres in England and Wales. There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence of SVB between groups, with 35.2% of women achieving a SVB in the upright group, compared with 41.1% in the lying-down group (adjusted risk ratio 0.86, 95% confidence interval 0.78 to 0.94). There was no evidence of differences in most of the secondary maternal or neonatal outcomes, or in long-term outcomes at the 12-month follow-up. No significant overall cost differences were observed between upright and lying-down positions for mothers or their babies. Measurement of adherence was challenging in this unmasked trial, and adherence could be influenced by midwives' beliefs about the allocated positions. If adherence was poor, this would have diluted the difference between the two groups. There is clear evidence of the benefit of adopting a lying-down position in second-stage labour in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia, with no apparent disadvantages in either short- or long-term outcomes for mother or baby, and this is cost neutral for the NHS. Questions remain about whether or not other positions could increase the incidence of SVB further in this group of women. The results also raise questions about the role of maternal position in second-stage labour in women without an epidural. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN35706297.

Green Computer and Video Games: An Introduction	Whether framed as environmental communication, ’sustainable media’, ‘eco-media’, or ‘green popular culture’ environmental media and cultural studies constitutes an  embryonic  but  rapidly  developing  body  of  research.  The  vibrant,  multi-layered engagements of the eight essays collected here demonstrate not only that green gaming engages  with  all  of the  issues  addressed  in  that  research  but  also  that  games  and  game studies  can  expand  the  range  of  this  incipient  green  media  and  cultural  studies.  This volume  of Ecozon@is  the  first  collection  of  essays  to  focus  exclusively  on  the  topic  of ‘Green Computer and Video Games’. Working from these essays, we will demonstrate in Part  I  of this  introduction  how  attributes  specific to  gaming  might  address  and  expand our  understanding  of  environments  and  ecological  relations;  and,  in  Part  II,  how  these essays might help develop green game studies itself.	sustainable
The Relationship Between Birch Pollen, Air Pollution  and Weather Types and Their Effect on Antihistamine  Purchase in Two Swedish Cities	Exposure to elevated air pollution levels can  aggravate pollen allergy symptoms. The aim of this study  was to investigate the relationships between airborne  birch (Betula) pollen, urban air pollutants NO2, O3 and  PM10 and their effects on antihistamine demand in  Gothenburg and Malmo¨, Sweden, 2006–2012. Further,  the influence of large-scale weather pattern on pollen-/  pollution-related risk, using Lambweather types (LWTs),  was analysed. Daily LWTs were obtained by comparing  the atmospheric pressure over a 16-point grid system over  southern Sweden (scale *3000 km). They include two  non-directional types, cyclonic (C) and anticyclonic  (A) and eight directional types depending on the wind  direction (N, NE, E…). Birch pollen levels were  exceptionally high under LWTs E and SE in both cities.  Furthermore, LWTs with dry and moderately calm  meteorological character (A, NE, E, SE) were associated  with strongly elevated air pollution (NO2 and PM10) in  Gothenburg. For most weather situations in both cities,  simultaneously high birch pollen together with high air  pollution had larger over-the-counter (OTC) sales of  antihistamines than situations with high birch pollen  alone. LWTs NE, E, SE and S had the highest OTC sales  in both cities. InGothenburg, the city with a higher load of  both birch pollen and air pollution, the higher OTC sales  were especially obvious and indicate an increased effect  on allergic symptoms from air pollution. Furthermore,  GothenburgLWTs A, NE, E and SEwere associatedwith  high pollen and air pollution levels and thus classified as  high-risk weather types. In Malmo¨, corresponding highrisk  LWTs were NE, E, SE and S. Furthermore,  occurrence of high pollen and air pollutants as well as  OTC sales correlated strongly with vapour pressure  deficit and temperature in Gothenburg (much less so in  Malmo¨). This provides evidence that the combination of  meteorological properties associated with LWTs can  explain high levels of birch pollen and air pollution. Our  study shows that LWTs represent a useful tool for  integrated daily air quality forecasting/warning.	cities
Upright Versus Lying Down Position in Second Stage of Labour in Nulliparous Women With Low Dose Epidural: BUMPES Randomised Controlled Trial	INTERVENTIONS  Women were allocated to an upright or lying down position, using a secure web based randomisation service, stratified by centre, with no masking of participants or clinicians to the trial interventions.  MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES  The primary outcome was spontaneous vaginal birth. Women were analysed in the groups into which they were randomly allocated, regardless of position recorded at any time during the second stage of labour (excluding women with no valid consent, who withdrew, or who did not reach second stage before delivery). Secondary outcomes included mode of birth, perineal trauma, infant Apgar, delivery (adjusted risk ratio 1.08, 99% confidence interval 0.99 to 1.18), obstetric anal sphincter injury (1.27, 0.88 to 1.84), infant Apgar score <4 at five minutes (0.66, 0.06 to 6.88), and maternal faecal incontinence at one year (1.18, 0.61 to 2.28).  CONCLUSIONS  Evidence shows that lying down in the second stage of labour results in more spontaneous vaginal births in nulliparous women with epidural analgesia, with no apparent disadvantages in relation to short or longer term outcomes for mother or baby.	women
Learning is Like a Lava Lamp:  The Student Journey to Critical Thinking	This paper explores the ways in which a university Foundation Degree programme supports undergraduate early years students to develop critical thinking, mindfulness and self-actualisation through their lived personal and professional experiences. It considers the impact of this on graduates employed within the Early Years sector. Findings inform future design of a University Foundation Degree programme situated within Early Childhood Education and Care (ECEC). As undergraduates, students engage in higher-level learning aligned to their practice within the workplace.  An interpretive Participatory Qualitative Research methodology is used to gather the views of 6 alumni who completed their studies in 2014.  They participated in the research freely within ethical parameters approved by a university ethics committee.  Findings revealed that the development of critical thinking is empowered by having a personal or professional impetus, which in the case of Early Years is the child as being at the heart of values based practice. This, with the inclusion of mindfulness, drives students to a sustainable deeper layer of thinking to achieve self-actualisation. Through the acquisition of critical thinking students have been subsequently able to take up positions of authority within the early years workforce.	sustainable
Enhancing Graduate Prospects by Recording and Reflecting on Part-time Work: A Challenge to Students and Universities	Business leaders are becoming increasingly explicit regarding the skills, attributes and behaviours expected of graduate entrants. These skills are often developed through a combination of academic studies and work experience. While universities are increasingly providing opportunities for experiential learning, typically a placement year or internship, a growing number of students are undertaking self-initiated part-time work alongside their full-time degree studies. This part-time employment, typically in retail or hospitality, will help develop the skills, attributes and behaviours that employers demand. However, it is important that graduates are able to elucidate their learning to future employers during the graduate recruitment process. The purpose of this viewpoint article is to challenge full-time degree students who are working part-time to record (perhaps through a logbook) and reflect on their work experience so that they will be able to provide concrete examples to reinforce their skills and experience. The article concludes by discussing the role of universities in the process. Â© The Author(s) 2017.	employment
Plans, Preferences or Going with the Flow: an Online Exploration of Women’s Views and Experiences of Birth Plans	Objective  To explore women’s views of birth plans, and experiences of their completion and use.  Design  A qualitative, exploratory study, using Internet-mediated research methods.  Setting  The discussion boards of two well-known, UK-based, online parenting forums, where a series of questions relating to birth plans were posted.  Participants  Members of the selected parenting forums who had written and used, or who had chosen not to write or use, a birth plan.  Findings  Women responded with a range of views and experiences relating to the completion and use of birth plans.  The benefits of birth plans were described in terms of communication with healthcare professionals, potentially enhancing awareness of available options, and maintaining a sense of control during labour and birth.  However, many respondents believed the idea of ‘planning’ birth was problematic, and described a reluctance to write a formal plan.  The support of healthcare professionals, particularly midwives, was considered essential to the success of both writing and using birth plans.  Key conclusions  Our findings show a continued debate among women on the benefits and challenges involved in writing and using birth plans, suggesting problems for a ‘one size fits all’ approach often seen in the use of birth plan templates.  In the context of maternity policy supporting women’s choice and personalised care, and as a way of acknowledging perceived problems of ‘planning’ for birth, a flexible approach to birth plans is required, including the consideration of employing alternative nomenclature.    Implications for practice  Birth plans remain a point of contention in care contexts around the world.  Midwives and other healthcare providers play a central role in supporting women to discuss available options, whether or not they decide to complete a formal birth plan.	women
Quality of Life, Coping Styles, Stress Levels, and Time Use in Mothers of Children with Autism Spectrum Disorders: Comparing Single Versus Coupled Households	This study aimed to examine the influence of differences in household status on the parental stress, coping, time use and quality of life (QoL) among mothers of children with autism spectrum disorders. Forty-three single and 164 coupled mothers completed the survey. Data were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. We found that single mothers were 1.05 times more likely to report lower levels of environmental QoL. Whilst they were 1.73 times more likely to use acceptance coping style, this association did not persist after adjusting for total number of children, household income and employment status. There was no difference in time use and stress between these mothers. Possible environmental issues for single mothers and implications for future research are discussed.

Gender Differences in Early Reading Strategies: a Comparison of Synthetic Phonics Only with a Mixed Approach to Teaching Reading to 4-5 Year-Old Children	A survey of primary schools in England found that girls outperform boys in English across all phases (Ofsted in Moving English forward. Ofsted, Manchester, 2012). The gender gap remains an on-going issue in England, especially for reading attainment. This paper presents  evidence of gender differences in learning to read that  emerged during the development of a reading scheme for  4- and 5-year-old children in which 372 children from  Reception classes in sixteen schools participated in  12-month trials. There were three arms per trial: Intervention non-PD (non-phonically decodable text with mixed methods teaching); Intervention PD (phonically decodable text with mixed methods teaching); and a ‘business as usual’ control condition SP (synthetic phonics and decodable text). Assignment to Intervention condition was randomised. Standardised measures of word reading and comprehension were used. The research provides statistically significant evidence suggesting that boys learn more easily using a mix of whole-word and synthetic phonics approaches. In addition, the evidence indicates that boys learn to read more easily using the natural-style language of ‘real’ books including vocabulary which goes beyond their assumed decoding ability. At post-test, boys using the nonphonically decodable text with mixed methods (Intervention  A) were 8 months ahead in reading comprehension  compared to boys using a wholly synthetic phonics  approach.	girls
Choice, Informed Consent and Risk-Managing Women’s Care Choices in the Absence of Midwifery Supervision: The Birth Choice Clinic	Women with ‘low-risk’ pregnancies are largely encouraged through research and national policy to  deliver in midwifery-led units or at home; however, the majority continue to attend consultant-led  hospital settings. Much research exists to support midwives in facilitating informed choice but it has  been identified that midwives are often influenced by internal and external factors when providing  this and that time constraints can hinder the process. Supervisors of midwives (SoM) provide a  complex care planning service to women. However, with SoM removed from statute and the new  Advocating for Education and Quality Improvement (A-EQUIP) model not yet widely operational,  a ‘gap’ area has been identified as a potential concern. This ‘gap’ is complex care planning with  women. In response to national changes, an alternative approach at Gloucestershire Hospitals NHS  Foundations Trust to SoM providing complex care planning is the Birth Choice Clinic.	women
Aerobiology in the International Journal of Biometeorology, 1957--2017	Aerobiology and biometeorology are related fields. Here we provide a broad review of aerobiology articles published in the International Journal of Biometeorology (IJB) over the past 60 years. We consider how the quantity of such work has varied over this period as well as which regions and countries have been the focus of such work, and where there is a relative paucity. We then focus on a number of highlights and themes in this research, including aerobiology and climate change and aerobiological modelling and forecasting. While much of the article focusses on airborne pollen research, we also discuss the extent to which other airborne organic particles such as fungal spores and bacteria have been the focus of research published in IJB. Also considered are knowledge gaps and research needs and priorities with respect to the field of aerobiology. While the IJB has been one of the main platforms for presenting aerobiological research over recent decades, the article highlights the need for the field of aerobiology to embrace new sampling technologies such as spectral analysis and next-generation sequencing to identify and quantify airborne biological particles.	climate change
Developing a Staged Competency Based Approach to Enterprise Creation	Entrepreneurialism is a concept which affects individuals in a range of different ways (Jones et al 2014). In this paper the authors are interested in exploring how entrepreneurial activity can improve a person's propensity to create new ventures and how educational frameworks applied in a university context can be devised to specifically support this development.  Building on previous work (Churchill and Lewis, 1983; Gartner, 1985; Draycott and Rae, 2011; Lackéus et al 2016), the Authors will explore a range of frameworks to identify elements which are useful and then develop these to propose a model which, they believe, will support the facilitation of experiential entrepreneurship education to show tangible results in the creation and growth (Blank and Dorf, 2010) of new ventures.   The authors believe that this is important to increase discussion surrounding the development of experiential entrepreneurial education programmes (Jones et al 2014, Lackéus et al 2016), their impact (Kozlinska, 2016) and the ways in which university-based entrepreneurship programs, incorporating real-life venture creation, can bridge the gap (Lackéus and Williams Middleton, 2015) between entrepreneurship education and enterprise creation within the university environment.  The paper discusses how the focal competence needed depends on the stage of the business and not necessarily on the academic level, mapping these to the EntreComp: The Entrepreneurship Competence Framework (Bacigalupo et al., 2016).   To achieve this the paper will propose a staged, process-based approach to entrepreneurial education design which draws on the work of Kuratko and Morris (2015) to break the entrepreneurial effort into specific stages, or steps. This staged framework for entrepreneurial development will map the focal competencies and skills required for each of the stages of development and with the requirements for the entrepreneurial process integrative framework.   The model nine stages are: Discovery, Modeling, Startup, Existence, Survival, Success, Adaption, Independence and Exit. The first three stages bring about a robust business idea and formation which are core developments within an educational setting. The next three develop the venture and the entrepreneur into a sustainable business entity and the last three provide entrepreneurial pathways.  The resulting framework provides an identifiable path for educators, researchers, managerial practice and quality assurance for the support of entrepreneurs and their businesses. In teaching, the approach should be structured around the frameworks to capture the full content of entrepreneurship as opposed to a more narrow focus on case studies, business plans, and other experiential exercises. This paper leads the educator to a more comprehensive understanding of the dynamic nature of entrepreneurship, the skills required, the processes involved, the relationship between the entrepreneur and the venture, and the stages required to achieve this.

Macroinvertebrate Taxonomic and Functional Trait Compositions Within Lotic Habitats Affected by River Restoration Practices	The widespread degradation of lotic ecosystems has prompted extensive river restoration efforts globally, but many studies have reported modest ecological responses to rehabilitation practices. The functional properties of biotic communities are rarely examined within post-project appraisals, which would provide more ecological information underpinning ecosystem responses to restoration practices and potentially pinpoint project limitations. This study examines macroinvertebrate community responses to three projects which aimed to physically restore channel morphologies. Taxonomic and functional trait compositions supported by widely occurring lotic habitats (biotopes) were examined across paired restored and non-restored (control) reaches. The multivariate location (average community composition) of taxonomic and functional trait compositions differed marginally between control and restored reaches. However, changes in the amount of multivariate dispersion were more robust and indicated greater ecological heterogeneity within restored reaches, particularly when considering functional trait compositions. Organic biotopes (macrophyte stands and macroalgae) occurred widely across all study sites and supported a high alpha (within-habitat) taxonomic diversity compared to mineralogical biotopes (sand and gravel patches), which were characteristic of restored reaches. However, mineralogical biotopes possessed a higher beta (between-habitat) functional diversity, although this was less pronounced for taxonomic compositions. This study demonstrates that examining the functional and structural properties of taxa across distinct biotopes can provide a greater understanding of biotic responses to river restoration works. Such information could be used to better understand the ecological implications of rehabilitation practices and guide more effective management strategies.	ecosystems
Beneficial Effects on Fasting Insulin and Postprandial Responses Through 7-day Intake of New Zealand Blackcurrant Powder	Background: Blood glucose and insulin are elevated after intake of carbohydrate, with levels returning to normal in about 2-3 hours after ingestion. We examined the effects of daily New Zealand blackcurrant intake over 7 days on fasting glucose and insulin levels and the responses of glucose and insulin during an oral glucose tolerance test (i.e. OGTT). Methods: Seventeen healthy participants (9 males, 8 females, age: 24±8 years, body mass: 75.4±16.4 kg, height 172±11 cm, body mass index: 25.3±3.3) consumed 6 g·day-1 New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) powder for 7 days. Every 6 g of the serving contained 138.6 mg anthocyanins, 49 mg vitamin C, and 5.2 g of carbohydrates with total phenolic content 271.6 mg. A cross-over design was used. Participants completed one OGTT before starting the supplementation (day 0) and another OGTT after 7 days of the supplementation (day 7). For the OGTT, participants were seated and consumed 75 g of glucose dissolved in 250 mL water. Finger prick capillary samples were taken before and every 30 minutes for a total of 120 minutes after consuming the glucose drink. Following duplicate glucose analysis, blood samples were centrifuged and then plasma was separated and frozen (-20°C) for triplicate insulin analysis using a human 96-well insulin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (IBL international, Hamburg, Germany). Results: NZBC had no effect on fasting glucose (control: 4.46±0.45; NZBC: 4.41±0.44 mmol·L1, P=0.657), although there was a trend for fasting insulin to be 14.3% lower (control: 66.5±28.2; NZBC: 57.0±29.5 pmol·L-1) (P=0.091). HOMA-IR was not different between the control and NZBC (1.81±0.73 vs 1.58±0.83) (P=0.126). With NZBC during the OGTT, plasma glucose at 60 min was 8.1% lower (control: 6.68±1.13; NZBC: 6.14±1.41 mmol·L-1; P=0.016), insulin at 30 min was 18.4% lower (control: 337.1±228.3; NZBC: 275.0±136.4 pmol·L-1; P= 0.021), and insulin at 60 min was 39.2% lower (control: 297.8±154.3; NZBC: 181.2±97.4 pmol·L-1; P= 0.002). With NZBC during the OGTTs, areas-under-the-curve for plasma glucose (control: 752.6±79.4, NZBC: 709.8±93.3 mmol·L-1·120 min) and insulin (control: 28443±12816, NZBC: 20406±7985, pmol·L-1·120 min) were 5.7% (P=0.051) and 31.1% lower (P<0.001) respectively. Conclusion: A trend for lower fasting insulin with normal glucose and lower areas under the curve for glucose and insulin suggests that repeated intake of New Zealand blackcurrant powder increases insulin sensitivity. This is the first observation of a high-anthocyanin containing berry powder to increase insulin sensitivity. Regular intake of New Zealand blackcurrant powder may be beneficial for the postprandial responses in people with type 2 diabetes or metabolic syndrome.	water
Evaluation of a Bespoke Training to Increase Uptake by Midwifery Teams of NICE Guidance for Membrane Sweeping to Reduce Induction of Labour: a Stepped Wedge Cluster Randomised Design	Abstract Background: National guidance recommends pregnant women are offered membrane sweeping at term to reduce induction of labour. Local audit suggested this was not being undertaken routinely across two maternity units in the West Midlands, UK between March and November 2012. Methods: Bespoke training session for midwifery teams (nine community and one antenatal clinic) was developed to address identified barriers to encourage offer of membrane sweeping, together with an information leaflet for women and appointment of a champion within each team. The timing of training session on membrane sweeping to ten midwifery teams was randomly allocated using a stepped wedge cluster randomised design. All women who gave birth in the Trusts after 39+3/40 weeks gestation within the study time period were eligible. Relevant anonymised data were extracted from maternity notes for three months before and after training. Data were analysed using a generalised linear mixed model, allowing for clustering and adjusting for temporal effects. Primary outcomes were number of women offered and accepting membrane sweeping and average number of sweeps per woman. Sub-group comparisons were undertaken for adherence to Trust guidance and potential influence of pre-specified maternal characteristics. Data included whether sweeping was offered but declined and no record of membrane sweeping. Results: Training was given to all teams as planned. Analyses included data from 2787 of the 2864 (97%) eligible low-risk women over 39+4 weeks pregnant. Characteristics of the women were similar before and after training. No evidence of difference in proportion of women being offered and accepting membrane sweeping (44.4% before training versus 46. 8% after training (adjusted relative risk [aRR]=0.90, 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.71–1.13), nor in average number of sweeps per woman (0.603 versus 0.627, aRR=0.83, 95% CI=0.67–1.01). No differences in any secondary outcomes nor influence of maternal characteristics were demonstrated. The midwives evaluated training positively. Conclusions: This stepped wedge cluster trial enabled randomised evaluation within a natural roll-out and demonstrates the importance of robust evaluation in circumstances in which it is rarely undertaken. While the midwives evaluated the training positively, it did not appear to change practice.	women
Intimate Partner Violence and Pregnancy Intentions: A Qualitative Study	Aim and Objective  In this qualitative study we explored women’s pregnancy intentions and experiences of intimate partner violence before, during and after pregnancy.  Background  Unintended pregnancies in the context of intimate partner violence can have serious health, social and economic consequences for women and their children.  Design  Feminist and phenomenological philosophies underpinned the study to gain a richer understanding of women’s experiences.  Methods  Eleven women who had been pregnant in the previous two years were recruited from community-based women’s refuges in one region of the United Kingdom. Of the eleven women, eight had unplanned pregnancies, two reported being coerced into early motherhood, and only one woman had purposively planned her pregnancy.  Multiple in-depth interviews focused on participants’ accounts of living with intimate partner violence. Experiential data analysis was used to identify, analyse and  highlight themes.  Results  Three major themes were identified: men’s control of contraception, partner’s indiscriminate response to the pregnancy, and women’s mixed feelings about the pregnancy. Participants reported limited influence over their sexual relationship and Accepted Article This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved.  birth control. Feelings of vulnerability about themselves and fear for their unborn babies’ safety were intensified by their partners’ continued violence during pregnancy.  Conclusion  Women experiencing intimate partner violence were more likely to have an unintended pregnancy. This could be attributed to male dominance and fear, which  impacts on a woman’s ability to manage her birth control options. The women’s initial excitement about their pregnancy diminished in the face of uncertainty and ongoing  violence within their relationship.   Relevance to clinical practice  Women experiencing violence lack choice in relation to birth control options leading to unintended pregnancies. Interpreting the findings from the victim-perpetrator  interactive spin theory of intimate partner violence provides a possible framework for midwives and nurses to better understand and respond to women’s experiences of  violence during pregnancy.	women
The ‘Cumberbatch’ Hamlet (1):‘The Very Age and Body of the Time His Form and Pressure’	This essay reads Lyndsey Turner’s 2015 Hamlet at the Barbican Theatre in London against the production’s priorities, namely, being star, new audience and box-office driven. It explores the negotiation of the script, space and politics at the heart of this production. Giving its due when discussing the cinematic employment of cuts, editing, lighting and freeze frames, it acknowledges that some of the special effects were lost to the theatre spectator, per force cast in a secondary role in a production that prioritised live-streaming across the world.	employment
Double-trouble: Negotiating Gender and Sexuality in Post-colonial Women’s Rugby in Fiji	Although women’s exclusion in sport has attracted significant attention in the western context,   similar issues in relation to post-colonial societies have remained in the margins of the sociology   of sport. By analysing primary, interview-based evidence, in this article we explore the challenges   female rugby players face regarding gender and sexuality in Fiji; a male dominated post-colonial   society. In particular, we focus on participants’ resistance to dominant cultural practices and ways   in  which  they  (re)negotiate  gender  norms  and  sexuality  in  a  double-bind  struggle  against  both    traditional and sporting male hegemonies. We argue that the case of Fijian women rugby players   illustrates an interplay between a multiplicity of power relations in sport in a post-colonial society   and the resilience with which the athletes negotiate and respond to them, as well as the dynamic   nature and the transformative potential of their everyday practices.	women
Conduct Disorder Symptoms in Pre-School Children Exposed to Intimate Partner Violence: Gender Differences in Risk and Resilience	This study utilized data involving 7,743 children (51.6% boys) aged four from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) cohort.  Children were cross-categorized into four groups: Resilient, Non-resilient, Vulnerable and Competent.  Maternal depression and life events, parenting, attachment, social development and temperament were analyzed as dependent variables, and were examined as predictors of group membership.  Results showed that resilient boys were less emotional, less active, and more shy and had higher-educated mothers than the non-resilient boys.  Resilient girls were less emotional, less active, more shy, less socially developmentally advanced, had more secure attachment to their mothers, and their mothers were better educated and reported more positive parenting strategies than non-resilient girls.  Different approaches to intervention may be needed for IPV-exposed preschool boys and girls.	girls
Spatial and Temporal Variations in the Annual Pollen Index Recorded by Sites Belonging to the Portuguese Aerobiology Network	This study presents the findings of a 10-year survey carried out by the Portuguese Aerobiology Network (RPA) at seven pollen-monitoring stations: five mainland stations (Oporto, Coimbra, Lisbon, Évora and Portimão) and two insular stations [Funchal (Madeira archipelago) and Ponta Delgada (Azores archipelago)]. The main aim of the study was to examine spatial and temporal variations in the Annual Pollen Index (API) with particular focus on the most frequently recorded pollen types. Pollen monitoring (2003–2012) was carried out using Hirst-type volumetric spore traps, following the minimum recommendations proposed by the European Aerobiology Society Working Group on Quality Control. Daily pollen data were examined for similarities using the Kruskal–Wallis nonparametric test and multivariate regression trees. Simple linear regression analysis was used to describe trends in API. The airborne pollen spectrum at RPA stations is dominated by important allergenic pollen types such as Poaceae, Olea and Urticaceae. Statistically significant differences were witnessed in the API recorded at the seven stations. Mean API is higher in the southern mainland cities, e.g. Évora, Lisbon and Portimão, and lower in insular and littoral cities. There were also a number of significant trends in API during the 10-year study. This report identifies spatial and temporal variations in the amount of airborne pollen recorded annually in the Portuguese territory. There were also a number of significant changes in API, but no general increases in the amount of airborne pollen.	cities
Challenges Using Extrapolated Family-level Macroinvertebrate Metrics in Moderately Disturbed Tropical Streams: a Case-study From Belize	Family-level biotic metrics were originally designed to rapidly assess gross organic pollution effects, but came to be regarded as general measures of stream degradation.  Improvements in water quality in developed countries have reignited debate about the limitations of family-level taxonomy to detect subtle change, and is resulting in a shift back towards generic and species-level analysis to assess smaller effects.  Although the scale of pollution characterizing past condition of streams in developed countries persists in many developing regions, some areas are still considered to be only moderately disturbed. We sampled streams in Belize to investigate the ability of family-level macroinvertebrate metrics to detect change in stream catchments where less than 30% of forest had been cleared.  Where disturbance did not co-vary with natural gradients of change, and in areas characterized by low intensity activities, none of the metrics tested detected significant change, despite evidence of environmental impacts.  We highlight the need for further research to clarify the response of metrics to disturbance over a broader study area that allows replication for confounding sources of natural variation.  We also recommend research to develop more detailed understanding of the taxonomy and ecology of Neotropical macroinvertebrates to improve the robustness of metric use.	water
Mapping the Spatio-temporal Distribution of Key Vegetation Cover Properties in Lowland River Reaches, Using Digital Photography	The presence of vegetation in stream ecosystems is highly dynamic in both space and time. A digital photography technique is developed to map aquatic vegetation cover at species level, which has a very-high spatial and a flexible temporal resolution. A digital single-lens-reflex (DSLR) camera mounted on a handheld telescopic pole is used. The low-altitude (5 m) orthogonal aerial images have a low spectral resolution (Red-Green-Blue), high spatial resolution (~1.9 pixels cm-2, ~1.3 cm length) and flexible temporal resolution (monthly). The method is successfully applied in two lowland rivers to quantify four key properties of vegetated rivers: vegetation cover, patch size distribution, biomass and hydraulic resistance. The main advantages are that the method is: (i) suitable for continuous and discontinuous vegetation covers (ii) of very-high spatial and flexible temporal resolution, (iii) relatively fast compared to conventional  ground survey methods, (iv) non-destructive, (v) relatively cheap and easy to use, and (vi) the software is widely available and similar open source alternatives exist. The study area should be less than 10 m wide and the prevailing light conditions and water turbidity levels should be sufficient to look into the water. Further improvements of the images processing are expected in the automatic delineation and classification of the vegetation patches.	ecosystems,water
Pollen-monitoring: Between Analyst Proficiency Testing	This study presents the results of a Europe-wide training and Quality Control (QC) exercise carried out within the framework of the European Aerobiology Society’s QC Working Group and European COST Action FA1203 entitled “sustainable management of Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Europe (SMARTER)” with the aim of ensuring that pollen counters in Europe are confident in the identification of Ambrosia pollen grains. A total of 69 analysts from 20 countries examined a test slide by light microscopy, which contained Ambrosia pollen and pollen from other Asteraceae that could be recorded in the atmosphere at the same time of year (i.e. Artemisia, Iva, and Xanthium). Daily average pollen concentrations produced by individual participants were compared with the assigned value and the bias was measured by z-score. Both the assigned value and standard deviation for proficiency testing were calculated following the consensus value principle (ISO13528:2005) from the results reported by all the participants in the test. It took a total of 531 days from when the exercise commenced until all 69 analysts reported their results. The most outliers were reported for Artemisia pollen concentrations followed by Xanthium and Iva. The poor results for Artemisia and Xanthium were probably caused by low concentrations on the test slide leading to larger bias due to the unequal distribution of pollen over the microscope slide. Participants performed the best in identifying and quantifying Ambrosia pollen. Performing inter-laboratory ring tests with the same sample is very time consuming and might not be appropriate for large-scale proficiency testing in aerobiology. Pollen with similar morphology should be included in the education process of aerobiologists.	sustainable
Spatial and Temporal Variations in Airborne Ambrosia Pollen in Europe	Aim: The European Commission Cooperation in Science and Technology (COST) Action FA1203 “SMARTER” aims to make recommendations for the sustainable management of Ambrosia across Europe and for monitoring its efficiency and cost effectiveness. The goal of the present study is to provide a baseline for spatial and temporal variations in airborne Ambrosia pollen in Europe that can be used for the management and evaluation of this noxious plant .  Location: The full range of Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. distribution over Europe (39oN-60oN; 2oW-45oE).  Methods: Airborne Ambrosia pollen data for the principal flowering period of Ambrosia (August-September) recorded during a 10-year period (2004-2013) were obtained from 242 monitoring sites. The mean sum of daily average airborne Ambrosia pollen and the number of days that Ambrosia pollen was recorded in the air were analysed. The mean and Standard Deviation (SD) were calculated regardless of the number of years included in the study period, while trends are based on those time series with 8 or more years of data. Trends were considered significant at p < 0.05.  Results: There were few significant trends in the magnitude and frequency of atmospheric Ambrosia pollen (only 8% for the mean sum of daily average Ambrosia pollen concentrations and 14% for the mean number of days Ambrosia pollen was recorded in the air).   Main conclusions: The direction of any trends varied locally and reflect changes in sources of the pollen, either in size or in distance from the monitoring station. Pollen monitoring is important for providing an early warning of the expansion of this invasive and noxious plant.	sustainable
Mindfulness and the Quality of Romantic Relationships: Is it All About Well-Being?	Studies have shown that mindfulness is positively associated with a number of individual factors related to well-being, attention and awareness, and life satisfaction. Mindfulness has also been shown to be positively associated with the  perceived quality of romantic relationships. However, the factors underlying the connection between mindfulness and relationship quality are not well understood. A study is reported in which the connection between mindfulness and perceived relationship quality was investigated when individual life satisfaction was controlled for. The results suggest that individual life satisfaction partially mediates the association between mindfulness and relationship quality  but that other factors also contribute to that association. Possible additional mediating factors and ideas for possible future studies that could throw light on this connection are discussed.	well-being
Women and Lancashire Conservatism Between the Wars	The activism of women Conservatives helped Tory democracy to adapt and survive in inter-war Lancashire at a time when it was under strain due to the arrival of Labour as a significant electoral force. This article utilises the surviving records of the party in Lancashire to examine the various ways that women entered, navigated, justified and expanded their membership and function in inter-war Conservatism. It acknowledges the limits on women's advancement and influence, but it also highlights how some women made significant progress in rising through the party structures, and how women's branches facilitated this political mobility. It challenges the assumption that women Conservatives were preoccupied with sociability and discussing domestic issues, and reveals their contribution to the electoral success of the party at local level, and interaction with Lancashire's distinct tradition of Conservatism.	women
Investigating Sources of Measured Forest-atmosphere Ammonia Fluxes Using Two-layer Bi-directional Modelling	Understanding and predicting the ammonia (NH3) exchange between the biosphere and the atmosphere is important due to the environmental consequences of the presence of reactive nitrogen (Nr) in the environment. The dynamics of the natural sources are, however, not well understood, especially not for forest ecosystems due to the complex nature of this soil-vegetation-atmosphere system. Furthermore, the high reactivity of NH3 makes it technically complex and expensive to measure and understand the forest-atmospheric NH3 exchange. The aim of this study is to investigate the NH3 flux partitioning between the ground layer, cuticle and stomata compartments for two temperate deciduous forest ecosystems located in Midwestern, USA (MMSF) and in Denmark (DK-Sor). This study is based on measurements and simulations of the surface energy balance,  fluxes of CO2 and NH3 during two contrasted periods of the forest ecosystems, a period with full developed canopy (MMSF) and a senescent period for the DK-Sor site, with leaf fall and leaf litter build-up. Both datasets indicate emissions of NH3 from the forest to the atmosphere. The two-layer NH3 compensation point model SURFATM-NH3 was used in combination with a coupled photosynthesis-stomatal conductance model to represent seasonal variation in canopy physiological activity for simulating both net ecosystem CO2 exchange rates (R2 = 0.77 for MMSF and R2 = 0.84 for DK-Sor) and atmospheric NH3  fluxes (R2 = 0.43 for MMSF and R2 = 0.60 for DK-Sor). A scaling of the ground layer NH3 emission potential (Гg) was successfully applied using the plant area index (PAI) to represent the build-up of a litter layer in the leaf fall period. For a closed green forest canopy (MMSF), unaffected by agricultural NH3 sources, NH3 was emitted with daytime fluxes up to 50 ng NH3-N m-2 s-1 and nighttime fluxes up to 30 ng NH3-N m-2 s-1. For a senescing forest (DK-Sor), located in an agricultural region, deposition rates of 250 ng NH3-N m-2 s-1 were measured prior to leaf fall, and emission rates up to 670 ng NH3-N m-2 s-1 were measured following leaf fall. For MMSF, simulated stomatal NH3 emissions explain the daytime flux observations well, and it is hypothesized that cuticular desorption is responsible for the observed NH3 emissions at night.  During leaf fall in DK-Sor, ground fluxes dominate the NH3 flux with a mean emission rate of 150 ng NH3-N m-2 s-1. This study shows that forests potentially comprise a natural source of NH3 to the atmosphere, and that it is crucial to take into account the bi-directional exchange processes related to both the stomatal, cuticular and ground layer pathways in order to realistically simulate forest–atmosphere fluxes of NH3.	ecosystems,energy
Return to Hanging Rock: Lost Children in a Gothic Landscape	Using the philosophical position of phenomenology this article examines the ways in which ideas of wildness combine with Australian Gothic tropes such as the white colonial lost child and the bush as a haunted locale to compose key features of an Australian Ecogothic. Joan Lindsay’s enigmatic novel Picnic at Hanging Rock (1967) has prompted scholars such as Lesley Kathryn Hawkes to describe how in Australian literature for both adults and children ‘the environment is far more than a setting or backdrop against which the plot takes place’ (Hawkes, 2011,67). On St Valentine’s Day in 1900 three young Australian girls and their teacher disappear from a school picnic at the ancient site of Mount Macedon in Victoria. The analysis, which focuses on Lindsay’s posthumously published chapter eighteen (1987) examines how elements of the material, sensing world combine with the mythological or sacred to connect the human protagonists with the gothic landscape they inhabit. The resulting intersubjectivity problematizes colonial ideology and unsettles notions of national identity.

Creative and Credible Evaluation for Arts, Health and Well-being: Opportunities and Challenges of Co-production	Background: This paper reports findings from a one-year UK  knowledge exchange (KE) project completed in 2015. Stakeholders’  experiences of evaluation were explored in order to develop online  resources to strengthen knowledge and capacity within the arts and  health sector (www.creativeandcredible.co.uk).  Methods: The project used mixed methods, including a survey,  interviews and focus groups, guided by a Stakeholder Reference  Group comprised of 26 leading UK evaluators, researchers, artists,  health professionals, commissioners and funders.  Results: The project identified opportunities for arts arising from  current health and social care policy agendas. It also identified  challenges including the lack of agreed evaluation frameworks and  difficulties in evaluation practice.  Conclusions: Co-production between stakeholders is needed to  strengthen evaluation practice and support the development of the  arts and health sector. Effective co-production can be undermined  by structural and cultural barriers as well as unequal stakeholder  relationships. The paper discusses recent initiatives designed to  support best practice.	well-being
Position Choice and Swimming Costs of Juvenile  Atlantic Salmon Salmo Salar in Turbulent Flow	Swimming costs (SCs) for fish have been shown to be affected by turbulence. However, this idea has not yet been implemented in habitat models, which often represent hydraulics using water velocity averaged over time and space. In this study, we analysed the habitat selection of individual juvenile Atlantic salmon Salmo salar (L. 1758) in relation to predicted SC in the turbulent flow of a large outdoor flume. We used a previously published SC model parameterized using mean velocity, turbulence intensity, water temperature and fish mass. Results showed that 86% of fish chose locations with significantly lower predicted SC than expected at random. Position choice was negatively related to predicted SC, mean velocity, spatial velocity gradient, and Reynolds stresses. Based on the findings, a novel habitat  suitability curve is recommended for juvenile Atlantic salmon. The results are expected to contribute towards the improvement of bioenergetics modelling to increase our understanding of the impacts of environmental changes and management activities.	water
The Development of Inclusive Learning Relationships  in Mainstream Settings: A Multimodal Perspective	The debate regarding the inclusion of children with Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) in mainstream education in the UK partly revolves around what makes the classroom environment inclusive. Through the potential  offered by the specific qualitative methodologies employed, this study aimed to explore the development of teachers’ pedagogical practices and learning relationships upon the inclusive education of children with special educational needs and disabilities in two primary school classes. The study considered the views and behaviours of primary school pupils with and without special educational needs, primary school teachers and teaching assistants (TAs) in one mainstream school. Drawing on a multimodal approach to discourse analysis to account for the complex relationships  between symbolic and non-verbal modes of classroom signification, the study explored how meaning is produced in classrooms and children’s modes of communication,  as well as in teachers’ practices. The two classes are compared on the basis of teaching observations, interviews, transcripts of dialogues, and analyses of classroom organisation and decoration. This paper suggests that the greatest influence on the educational and social outcomes of students with special educational needs is the behaviour and practices of the classroom teacher.	inclusive education
'Seen but not Heard'. Practitioners Work with Poverty and the Organising Out of Disadvantaged Children's Voices and Participation in the Early Years	Living in poverty disadvantages young children reducing school readiness. ‘Pedagogy of listening’ can potentially support resilience remediating against poverty’s negative effects. Little, though, is known about how early childhood education and care (ECEC) practitioners work with children in poverty and the attainment gap between such children and their peers remains significant within England and the US. This article reports research using a mixed methodology which explored these issues in localities across both these countries. We argue a dominant technocratic model of early years provision in these contexts creates normalisation and diversity reduction. This, and austerity measures, stymie pedagogical space and practice organising out listening to children in poverty. We suggest this may help explain why the attainment gap remains so stubbornly resistant to reduction across these countries.	poverty
Factors Associated with Desistance from Violence in Prison: An Exploratory Study	Desistance from crime has been of increasing interest within criminal justice literature, but desistance from offending behaviour whilst in custodial environments has not yet been investigated. Violence within prison establishments continues to be a significant problem, therefore this study investigated the factors that are associated with desistance from custodial violence in 63 UK Category C adult male prisoners with a record of violence in prison. Participants completed measures of eight social and subjective factors associated with desistance in community samples. Those who had desisted from prison violence for 12 months or more showed greater levels of pro-social attitudes, agency and resilience than those who persisted in violence. Agency independently predicted desistance and this was particularly the case for younger offenders. Internal shifts appeared to be supported by a positive work environment. It is concluded that in custody an internal shift in perspective is especially important for desistance, and that this can be supported by the social environment. Opportunities to intervene may be greater in younger prisoners. It is recommended that current initiatives in developing agency and positive social interaction, such as Psychologically Informed Planned Environments, are further developed.	justice
A New Approach to Measuring Moral Virtues: The Multi-Component Gratitude Measure	Empirical explorations of moral virtues have increased dramatically recently. This paper introduces a new method of assessing moral virtue using gratitude as an example; a virtue that continues to be a topic of great interest in psychology, philosophy and education. We argue, and demonstrate empirically, that to comprehensively examine a moral virtue, it is necessary to explore its cognitive, affective, attitudinal (including motivational), and behavioural aspects. We have created the 'Multi-Component Gratitude Measure' (MCGM) comprised of four components, each designed to assess a distinct dimension of the virtue of gratitude: (a) conceptions (or understandings) of gratitude; (b) grateful emotions; (c) attitudes towards gratitude; and (d) gratitude-related behaviours. In contrast to existing measures, the MCGM aims to comprehensively examine the major components that constitute this complex moral construct. In two studies we illustrate the value of assessing these four components of gratitude and how individuals can differ in the number and ‘type’ of components they exemplify. Importantly, we demonstrate how well-being increases linearly with the number of components a person possesses, as measured by three distinct measures of well-being. We discuss individual differences in gratitude experience and what this means for personal flourishing as well as future measurement of moral constructs.	well-being
A Computer Model of Drafting Effects on Collective Behavior in Elite 10,000 m Runners	Purpose  Drafting in cycling influences collective behaviour of pelotons. Whilst evidence for collective behaviour in competitive running events exists, it is not clear if this results from energetic savings conferred by drafting. This study modelled the effects of drafting on behavior in elite 10,000 m runners.  Methods  Using performance data from a men’s elite 10,000 m track running event, computer simulations were constructed using Netlogo 5.1 to test the effects of three different drafting quantities on collective behaviour: no drafting, drafting to 3m behind with up to ~8% energy savings (a realistic running draft); and drafting up to 3m behind with up to 38% energy savings (a realistic cycling draft). Three measures of collective behaviour were analysed in each condition; mean speed, mean group stretch (distance between first and last placed runner), and Runner Convergence Ratio (RCR) which represents the degree of drafting benefit obtained by the follower in a pair of coupled runners.  Results  Mean speeds were 6.32±0.28m.s-1, 5.57±0.18 m.s-1, and 5.51±0.13 m.s-1 in the cycling draft, runner draft, and no draft conditions respectively (all P<0.001). RCR was lower in the cycling draft condition, but did not differ between the other two. Mean stretch did not differ between conditions.  Conclusions  Collective behaviours observed in running events cannot be fully explained through energetic savings conferred by realistic drafting benefits. They may therefore result from other, possibly psychological, processes. The benefits or otherwise of engaging in such behavior are, as yet, unclear.	energy
Dietary Advice Provided to Those Undergoing Pelvic Radiotherapy	In those receiving radiotherapy for pelvic cancers, up to 80% develop gastrointestinal symptoms, with dietary interventions recommended to reduce these symptoms. However, research outlining the current dietary support provided to patients undergoing radiotherapy for pelvic cancer is lacking.    To identify the gastrointestinal symptoms experienced by those undergoing pelvic radiotherapy and to identify the dietary support provided to these patients.    A service evaluation was undertaken in one NHS Trust hospital whereby patients undergoing radical pelvic radiotherapy during a 15-week recruitment period were invited to complete an anonymous questionnaire. Participants were recruited using purposive sampling and the data were analysed descriptively using SPSS.    In total, 31 patients responded achieving a response rate of 48%. The most frequent reported gastrointestinal symptoms were gas and flatulence followed by diarrhoea, nausea and abdominal pain. The main dietary changes implemented by the respondents and recommended by health care professionals included reducing fibre intake, reducing certain vegetables, reducing caffeine and increasing water.    The results illustrate the impact of gastrointestinal side effects on patients’ dietary intake. The results highlight that nutritional guidance need to be standardised, especially for the management of diarrhoea and gas and flatulence as these were the most common occurring side effects. With radiographers most frequently giving nutritional advice they must be provided with guidance to support those undergoing pelvic radiotherapy.	water
Urban Ponds as an Aquatic Biodiversity Resource in Modified Landscapes	Urbanization is a global process contributing to the loss and fragmentation of natural habitats. Many studies have focused on the biological response of terrestrial taxa and habitats to urbanization. However, little is known regarding the consequences of urbanization on freshwater habitats, especially small lentic systems. In this study we examined aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity (family and species level) and variation in community composition between 240 urban and 782 non-urban ponds distributed across the UK. Contrary to predictions, urban ponds supported similar numbers of invertebrate species and families compared to non-urban ponds. Similar gamma diversity was found between the two groups at both family and species taxonomic levels. The biological communities of urban ponds were markedly different to those of non-urban ponds and the variability in urban pond community composition was greater than that in non-urban ponds, contrary to previous work showing homogenisation of communities in urban areas. Positive spatial autocorrelation was recorded for urban and non-urban ponds at 0-50 km (distance between pond study sites) and negative spatial autocorrelation was observed at 100-150 km, and was stronger in urban ponds in both cases. Ponds do not follow the same ecological patterns as terrestrial and lotic habitats (reduced taxonomic richness) in urban environments; in contrast they support high taxonomic richness and contribute significantly to regional faunal diversity. Individual cities are complex structural mosaics which evolve over long periods of time and are managed in diverse ways, promoting the development of a wide-range of environmental conditions and habitat niches in urban ponds which can promote greater heterogeneity between pond communities at larger scales. Ponds provide an opportunity for managers and environmental regulators to conserve and enhance freshwater biodiversity in urbanized landscapes whilst also facilitating key ecosystem services including storm water storage and water treatment.	cities,water
Social Workers, Service Users and Austerity – A Common Cause	In January 2016, the International  Federation of Social Workers hosted a  Solidarity Symposium on social work and  austerity, which BASW members attended  along with a number of European colleagues.  A statement was agreed, which said:  “Austerity is a flawed economic theory that  increases debt burden, unemployment,  homelessness, inequality and causes misery  upon the lives of citizens.”  Social workers know how short-sighted  cuts to preventive services are, as they can  put intolerable pressure on people who then  end up needing far more expensive provision.  Reclaiming advocacy as an essential social work role is needed for our service user and carer voices to be heard  inside as well as outside our agencies. As well  as giving a voice to service users and carers  we work with individually, we can form  alliances on an organisational level to combat the effects of austerity on the most vulnerable in our society.	inequality
Mapping the Birch and Grass Pollen Seasons in the UK Using Satellite Sensor Time-series	Grass and birch pollen are two major causes of seasonal allergic rhinitis (hay fever) in the UK and parts of Europe affecting around 15-20% of the population. Current prediction of these allergens in the UK is based on (i) measurements of pollen concentrations at a limited number of monitoring stations across the country and (ii) general information about the phenological status of the vegetation. Thus, the current prediction methodology provides information at a coarse spatial resolution only. Most station-based approaches take into account only local observations of flowering, while only a small number of approaches take into account remote observations of land surface phenology. The systematic gathering of detailed information about vegetation status nationwide would therefore be of great potential utility. In particular, there exists an opportunity to use remote sensing to estimate phenological variables that are related to the flowering phenophase and, thus, pollen release. In turn, these estimates can be used to predict pollen release at a fine spatial resolution. In this study, time-series of MERIS Terrestrial Chlorophyll Index (MTCI) data were used to predict two key phenological variables: the start of season and peak of season. A technique was then developed to estimate the flowering phenophase of birch and grass from the MTCI time-series. For birch, the timing of flowering was defined as the time after the start of the growing season when the MTCI value reached 25% of the maximum. Similarly, for grass this was defined as the time when the MTCI value reached 75% of the maximum. The predicted pollen release dates were validated with data from nine pollen monitoring stations in the UK. For both birch and grass, we obtained large positive correlations between the MTCI-derived start of pollen season and the start of the pollen season defined using station data, with a slightly larger correlation observed for birch than for grass. The technique was applied to produce detailed maps for the flowering of birch and grass across the UK for each of the years from 2003 to 2010. The results demonstrate that the remote sensing-based maps of onset flowering of birch and grass for the UK together with the pollen forecast from the Meteorology Office and National Pollen and Aerobiology Research Unit (NPARU) can potentially provide more accurate information to pollen allergy sufferers in the UK.	land
Embedding Employability in Non-vocational Undergraduate Courses: A Reflection on Practice Across the Institute of Health and Society at the University of Worcester	Employability can be defined simply as the character or quality of being employable (Hillage & Pollard, 1998). For students, undertaking a higher education degree is largely framed in terms of becoming more employable (McCowan, 2015) and, as a result, preferring courses that enable them to develop transferrable knowledge and skills which will increase their competitiveness in the labour market (Gosling, 2009). The concept of employability therefore continues to be highly relevant in a higher education context, for both students in work and those seeking work (McQuaid & Lindsay, 2005). Indeed, universities have an important responsibility to ensure their undergraduate courses have relevance to the employment market (Pothigai Selvan, 2013). The range of skills students develop in higher education is diverse, depending on their course and experience of work during study. Critical thinking, problem solving, research and analytical skills, interpersonal awareness, communication, self-reflection, time management, team working, and autonomy are key examples of skills developed during university and are highly attractive to a wide range of employers (Reddy, Lantz & Hulme, 2013). Given the importance of employability to students and prospective employers alike, it is imperative that careful consideration is given as to how to effectively embed employability across undergraduate courses. In light of this, this article aims to explore the ways in which employability is currently integrated across non-vocational disciplines within the Institute of Health and Society at University of Worcester, with a focus on key examples of practice drawn from Applied Criminology, Applied Health and Social Sciences and Psychology.	employment

Diagnostic Tests and their Application in the Management of Soil- and Water-borne Oomycete Pathogen Species	Oomycete diseases cause significant losses across a broad range of crop and aquaculture commodities worldwide. These losses can be greatly reduced by disease management practices steered by accurate and early diagnoses of pathogen presence. Determinations of disease potential can help guide optimal crop rotation regimes, varietal selections, targeted control measures, harvest timings and crop post-harvest handling. Pathogen detection prior to infection can also reduce the incidence of disease epidemics.  Classical methods for the isolation of oomycete pathogens are normally deployed only after disease symptom appearance. These processes are often-time consuming, relying on culturing the putative pathogen(s) and the availability of expert taxonomic skills for accurate identification; a situation that frequently results in either delayed application, or routine ‘blanket’ over-application of control measures. Increasing concerns about pesticides in the environment and the food chain, removal or restriction of their usage combined with rising costs have focussed interest in the development and improvement of disease management systems. To be effective, these require timely, accurate and preferably quantitatve diagnoses.  A wide range of rapid diagnostic tools, from point of care immunodiagnostic kits to next generation nucleotide sequencing have potential application in oomycete disease management.  Here we review currently-available as well as promising new technologies in the context of commercial agricultural production systems, considering the impacts of specific biotic and abiotic and other important factors such as speed and ease of access to information and cost effectiveness	water
Representing, Remembering and Rewriting Women’s Histories of the First World War	As Dan Todman has persuasively argued, in the British popular imagination the First World War is associated with mud, barbed wire, the trenches and the Tommy on the Western Front.  Perhaps inevitably, therefore, public commemoration of the war has often been dominated by a focus on the men in the armed forces, who risked or lost their lives for causes that at the time may or may not have seemed heroic, noble or simply unavoidable. The visual spectacle of Paul Cummins’ ‘Blood Swept Lands and Seas of Red’, the art installation at the Tower of London in which 888,246 ceramic poppies filled the moat from 17 July to 11 November 2014, was the most visited artistic response to the war in its centenary years, while Jeremy Deller’s ‘We’re Here Because We’re Here’, commemorating the first day of the Battle of the Somme, provided a widely seen and moving memorial to the victims.22. ‘We’re here because we’re here’ marked the centenary of the first day of the Battle of the Somme. Hundreds of volunteers, working with the artist Jeremy Deller, Birmingham Repertory Theatre, the National Theatre and 1914–18 NOW, commemorated the centenary by re-enacting as soldiers in cities, towns and the countryside around Britain. First World War soldiers were seen at train stations, shopping centres, beaches, car parks and high streets.   This vision of the conflict, focusing exclusively on the combatant dead, should not, however, become the only history of the conflict. There are, as the research brought together here demonstrates, multiple histories of the First World War.	cities,seas,women
Every Night the Universe Passes over Santiago. Transnational ‘Ecocinema’ and Visualising Environmental Histories in Patricio Guzmán’s Nostalgia for the Light	This paper tests the capacity of media and popular culture to articulate complex ecological ideas, carrying out an analysis of Patricio Guzmán’s 2010 documentary Nostalgia de la luz [Nostalgia for the Light]. Through applying and developing arguments involved in the study of “ecocinema”, including the concept of “flow”, the paper also considers the possibility that texts situated within a transnational media industry might articulate localized perspectives on place, nature, and people, able to resonate with a global audience. The film is set in the Atacama desert, a location which brings together cosmologists, palaeontologists, archaeologists, women searching for traces of the “disappeared”, and men who were imprisoned in the desert’s Chacabuco concentration camp – also the site of late 19th / early 20th century nitrate mining. According to Guzmán, these people are united by a common purpose: their ongoing attempt to uncover the stories of the past, from the origins of the universe to more recent social and political narratives. Through this emphasis on memory, the paper argues, Guzmán develops a radical form of nostalgia which reveals the desert’s significance not only to Chilean history but also its connection to the matter of the cosmos and to flows of global capital, a connection which implicates the film’s global audience both ecologically and socio-politically. Thus, the paper makes a case for the ecological significance of the film both in terms of the relationship it establishes between deep environmental and planetary history and a recent human history embedded in modernity, and its ability to foster a form of transnational eco-cosmopolitanism.	women
Malnutrition and Nutritional Support in Alcoholic Liver Disease: a Review	Malnutrition is associated with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and related complications such as hepatic encephalopathy and increased rate of infections. Avoidance of prolonged fasting and overly restrictive diets is important to avoid poor nutrition. Adequate intake of calories, protein, and micronutrients via frequent small meals and evening supplements and/or enteral and parenteral nutrition when indicated has been associated with reduced mortality and morbidity in patients with ALD. Modification of protein/fat sources and composition in addition to probiotic supplementation are promising interventions for decreased progression of ALD and its complications.	nutrition
Investigation of the Impact of ‘Fouling Out’ on Teams’ Performance in Elite Basketball	This study examined the impact of ‘fouling out’ on basketball team’s performance. A sample of 237 instances of ‘fouling-out’ were examined from 362 elite basketball games (group and knockout games from the 2010 to 2012 men’s and women’s Olympic Games, European and World Championships). Variables scrutinized were: score-line, quality of opposition, time-out situation, competition stage, minutes remaining, freethrows conceded, and player status. Two linear regression models were used to analyze the temporal effects of fouling out on both the team with the offending player and the opposition. The results indicated that both teams (the ‘fouling’ team and the opposition) demonstrated similar positive scoring performances post ‘foul-out’ during in the short-term (short term effect). However, post foul-out did impact negatively on the fouling team’s scoring process in the mid-term (mid-term effect). The quality of opposition variable was significant in all the analyses with negative effects for the fouling team and positive effects for the opposition. The final outcome highlighted a positive effect for the score-line (when the foul out was committed), the quality of the opposition, the competition stage, and for the time-out called by the fouling team. The results outlined implications for the coaching process such as methods for improving coaching strategies and game management of on-court players.	women
Are Career Termination Concerns Only for Athletes? A Case Study of the Career Termination of an Elite Female Coach	This paper presents a case study of an elite female coach and her career termination from a 20+ year career following a critical life incident. A novel autobiographical approach was adopted whereby the participant undertook expressive writing to describe her experiences prior to, during, and following coaching an athlete at the 2012 Summer Olympic Games. Thematic analysis indicated seven phases related to the participant’s experiences of the critical incident: Build up to the event, the event, the aftermath, recovery and reflection on the event, sampling of new avenues, enlightenment, and career re-birth. The findings reinforce the high demands placed upon elite coaches, the subsequent threats to physical and mental well-being, and the importance of having robust psychological skills and suitable social support to cope with these demands. Implications for preparing and supporting coaches for successful career transition are discussed.	well-being
Becoming a Kinship Carer – Education and Support Needs of Grandparents Who Are Parenting	Grandparent kinship carers have been found to have poor well-being and are often anxious about providing the best parenting support. This research worked with a group of grandparent kinship carers to discover their parenting needs with the aim of proposing parenting support. Using mixed methods the study found that a support system which addressed the specific needs of the children and the kinship carers, for example financial advice as well as coping with the children's complex behaviour, was preferred.  A patchwork approach where individual groups of kinship carers could commission bespoke provision was proposed as being a preferable option.	well-being
Refugee Entrepreneurship: A Conceptualisation of Key Business Decisions	The various conflicts around the world meant that 2015 has seen the highest refugee figures since World War Two. While some refugees need government support, others are determined to lead an independent life through self-employment (Betts, Bloom and Weaver, 2015; Dijkhuizen and Berkhout 2015; UNHCR 2015). However, we know very little about the economic lives of refugees (Betts, Bloom, Kaplan and Omata 2014), let alone their entrepreneurial activity.	employment
Adverse Childhood Life Events and Postpartum Psychosis  in Bipolar Disorder	Background  Women with bipolar disorder are at increased risk of postpartum psychosis. Adverse childhood life events have been associated with depression in the postpartum period, but have been little studied in relation to postpartum psychosis. In this study we investigated whether adverse childhood life events are associated with postpartum psychosis in a large sample of women with bipolar I disorder.     Methods  Participants were 432 parous women with DSM-IV bipolar I disorder recruited into the Bipolar Disorder Research Network (www.BDRN.org). Diagnoses and lifetime psychopathology, including perinatal episodes, were obtained via a semi-structured interview (Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry; Wing et al., 1990) and case-notes. Adverse childhood life events were assessed via self-report and case-notes, and compared between women with postpartum psychosis (n=208) and those without a lifetime history of perinatal mood episodes (n=224).    Results  There was no significant difference in the rate of any adverse childhood life event, including childhood sexual abuse, or in the total number of adverse childhood life events between women who experienced postpartum psychosis and those without a lifetime history of perinatal mood episodes, even after controlling for demographic and clinical differences between the groups.     Limitations  Adverse childhood life events were assessed in adulthood and therefore may be subject to recall errors.    Conclusions  We found no evidence for an association between adverse childhood life events and the occurrence of postpartum psychosis.  Our data suggest that, unlike postpartum depression, childhood adversity does not play a significant role in the triggering of postpartum psychosis in women with bipolar disorder.	women
Improving the Care Pathway for Women who Request Caesarean Section: An Experience-Based Co-Design Study	Background  Maternal request for Caesarean section is controversial and yet the NICE Caesarean section Guideline recommends that that if this is requested, following discussion of the risks and benefits, women should be supported in their choice. There was a desire to improve the pathway at Birmingham Women’s NHS Foundation Trust.    Methods  Experience-based co-design methodology uses service user and clinicians experiences collected using qualitative methods to jointly re-design services. Firstly semi-structured interviews were conducted to elicit the views and experiences of health care professionals and women who requested Caesarean section (with and without medical indication). Analysis identified key themes arising from the health care professionals’ interviews and ‘touch points’ (key moments or events related to the experience of care) arising from the interviews with women.. Separate workshops were then held with each group to ensure these resonated and to identify key areas for service improvement. At the first joint workshop a pathway using ‘audio clips’ demonstrating women’s agreed ‘touch points’ prompted discussion and joint working began to change the pathway. A final second workshop was held to agree changes to the pathway.    Results  Interviews were conducted with health care professionals (n = 22, 10 consultant obstetricians and 12 midwives) and women (n = 15). The women’s ‘touch points’ included repetition of request, delay in the decision for Caesarean section to be made, feeling judged, and that information was poor with similar findings identified from the health care professionals. Joint working resulted in a revised pathway for women who request Caesarean section.    Changes to the pathway for women as a result of the work include written information about ‘The way your baby may be born’ which is given to the woman followed by a discussion about mode of birth around the 16 week appointment. If the woman wishes to have a Caesarean section, referral is made to appropriate health care professionals (e.g., Consultant Midwife, counsellor) only if support and information would be useful. If Caesarean section is requested, woman is referred to a consultant obstetrician for an appointment at 20/40, with a decision by 28/40. Recording this in the notes minimises repeated challenge described by women. Final consent and timing of Caesarean section remain as recommended.    Conclusion  This has resulted in changes to the pathway agreed by a co-design process and which are acceptable to both health care professionals and women. Use of such methodologies should be considered more frequently when implementing service change.	women
The Accuracy and Reliability of Traditional Surface Flow Type Mapping: Is It Time for A New Method of Characterising Physical River Habitat?	Surface flow types (SFT) are advocated as ecologically relevant hydraulic units, often mapped visually from the bankside to characterise rapidly the physical habitat of rivers. SFT mapping is simple, non-invasive and cost-efficient. However, it is also qualitative, subjective and plagued by difficulties in recording accurately the spatial extent of SFT units. Quantitative validation of the underlying physical habitat parameters is often lacking, and does not consistently differentiate between SFTs. Here, we investigate explicitly the accuracy, reliability and statistical separability of traditionally mapped SFTs as indicators of physical habitat, using independent, hydraulic and topographic data collected during three surveys of a c. 50m reach of the River Arrow, Warwickshire, England. We also explore the potential of a novel remote sensing approach, comprising a small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) and Structure-from-Motion photogrammetry (SfM), as an alternative method of physical habitat characterisation. Our key findings indicate that SFT mapping accuracy is highly variable, with overall mapping accuracy not exceeding 74%. Results from analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) tests found that strong differences did not exist between all SFT pairs. This leads us to question the suitability of SFTs for characterising physical habitat for river science and management applications. In contrast, the sUAS-SfM approach provided high resolution, spatially continuous, spatially explicit, quantitative measurements of water depth and point cloud roughness at the microscale (spatial scales ≤1m). Such data are acquired rapidly, inexpensively, and provide new opportunities for examining the heterogeneity of physical habitat over a range of spatial and temporal scales. Whilst continued refinement of the sUAS-SfM approach is required, we propose that this method offers an opportunity to move away from broad, mesoscale classifications of physical habitat (spatial scales 10-100m), and towards continuous, quantitative measurements of the continuum of hydraulic and geomorphic conditions which actually exists at the microscale.	water
Development of a Knowledge Driven Rule Set for Classification of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation (SAV) in a Clear Water Stream: Where Do You Draw the Boundaries...?	A recent attempt at mapping submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) species composition of a clear water stream in Belgium from ultra-high resolution, multispectral photographs, using object based image analysis (OBIA), resulted in a low, but consistent overall classification accuracy (53-61%). Since the results were obtained with a single rule set they show promise for the development of an automated tool to map SAV despite the challenges of its submerged environment. This extended abstract investigates to what extent difficulties with species delineation in the validation data may have influenced the results. We compare class boundaries, as drawn by experts along image segmentation outlines, with the results from the expert knowledge driven classification rules. A comparison for ‘pure’ objects, where the expert is certain about the assigned object class, resulted in a moderately good overall similarity (68%), while inclusion of ambiguous objects reduces the results to 59%. Under ideal circumstances the rule set seems capable of 74% similarity with expert validation data.	water
Ice Slurry Ingestion Does Not Enhance Self-paced Intermittent Exercise in the Heat	This study aimed to determine if ice slurry ingestion improved self-paced intermittent exercise in the heat. After a familiarisation session, 12 moderately trained males (30.4 ± 3.4 year, 1.8 ± 0.1 cm, 73.5 ± 14.3 kg, inline imageO2max 58.5 ± 8.1 mL/kg/min) completed two separate 31 min self-paced intermittent protocols on a non-motorised treadmill in 30.9 ± 0.9 °C, 41.1 ± 4.0% RH. Thirty minutes prior to exercise, participants consumed either 7.5 g/kg ice slurry (0.1 ± 0.1 °C) (ICE) or 7.5 g/kg water (23.4 ± 0.9 °C) (CONTROL). Despite reductions in Tc (ΔTc: −0.51 ± 0.3 °C, P < 0.05) and thermal sensation prior to exercise, ICE did not enhance self-paced intermittent exercise compared to CONTROL. The average speed during the walk (CONTROL: 5.90 ± 1.0 km, ICE: 5.90 ± 1.0 km), jog (CONTROL: 8.89 ± 1.7 km, ICE: 9.11 ± 1.5 km), run (CONTROL: 12.15 ± 1.7 km, ICE: 12.54 ± 1.5 km) and sprint (CONTROL: 17.32 ± 1.3 km, ICE: 17.18 ± 1.4 km) was similar between conditions (P > 0.05). Mean Tsk, Tb, blood lactate, heart rate and RPE were similar between conditions (P > 0.05). The findings suggest that lowering Tc prior to self-paced intermittent exercise does not translate into an improved performance.	water
Survival Takes Time - a Range of Services is Required for a Range of Women’s Needs	Blogpost for the non partisan Women's Equality Party, their campaign 100 Days of May.  Beverley Gilbert considers that survival is a process that takes time, and as such, a range of women's services is required to meet the needs of women. We call on the government to fund specialist services for women surviving abuse that are designed specifically to address the needs of specific groups of women, recognising that not all women are the same and not all women want or need the same services.    Preventing violence against women and children includes helping women survive and rebuild their lives, and this process varies according to the particular circumstances of the individual woman. The government must rethink commissioning models to ensure that specialist services are available for all survivors.	women
064 The Building of the Bavarian Electronic Pollen Information Network - ePIN	Pollen monitoring is mostly performed manually. There is, however, a need for rapid reporting of pollen counts in addition to the alleviation of the workload of manual operation. We investigated the different steps needed for building an automatic pollen monitoring network in Bavaria, Germany. First, we tested the performance of the automatic pollen monitor BAA500, by comparing its data with data from a Hirst-type pollen trap at the same location. Next, during 2015, we built a new manual Bavarian pollen monitoring network with 27 Hirst-type pollen traps, including all closed but reopened operating traps from the German Polleninformation Network (PID). The selection of monitoring locations was based on: 1. Coverage of Bavarian land surface and population, but also 2. trying to represent the different environmental and climatic areas and 3. selecting the best positions to increase the predictability of pollen amounts based on forecasting models. Traps were located under optimal local monitoring conditions. The most informative locations were selected by applying redundancy and clustering analysis. Only 8 pollen traps are needed to cover most of variability in pollen dynamics. We found that three large groups of stations could be differentiated: 1. An extensive central cluster agglomerating most of the stations 2. a cluster agglomerating the stations located at the coldest areas of Bavaria and 3. a cluster of the Northern part of Bavaria. At the same time, we found the existence of eight sub-clusters related with different environmental conditions. We are now replacing these 8 manual stations by automatic pollen monitors and incorporating our network into local law to guarantee continuity.	land
Macroinvertebrate Diversity in Urban and Rural Ponds: Implications for Freshwater Biodiversity Conservation	Ponds are among the most biodiverse freshwater ecosystems, yet face significant threats from removal, habitat degradation and a lack of legislative protection globally. Information regarding the habitat quality and biodiversity of ponds across a range of land uses is vital for the long term conservation and management of ecological resources. In this study we examine the biodiversity and conservation value of macroinvertebrates from 91 lowland ponds across 3 land use types (35 floodplain meadow, 15 arable and 41 urban ponds). A total of 224 macroinvertebrate taxa were recorded across all ponds, with urban ponds and floodplain ponds supporting a greater richness than arable ponds at the landscape scale. However, at the alpha scale, urban ponds supported lower faunal diversity (mean: 22 taxa) than floodplain (mean: 32 taxa) or arable ponds (mean: 30 taxa). Floodplain ponds were found to support taxonomically distinct communities compared to arable and urban ponds. A total of 13 macroinvertebrate taxa with a national conservation designation were recorded across the study area and 12 ponds (11 floodplain and 1 arable pond) supported assemblages of high or very high conservation value. Pond conservation currently relies on the designation of individual ponds based on very high biodiversity or the presence of taxa with specific conservation designations. However, this site specific approach fails to acknowledge the contribution of ponds to freshwater biodiversity at the landscape scale. Ponds are highly appropriate sites outside of protected areas (urban/arable), with which the general public are already familiar, for local and landscape scale conservation of freshwater habitats.	ecosystems,land
Healthcare Staffs’ Experiences and Perceptions of Caring for People with Dementia in the Acute Setting: Qualitative Evidence Synthesis	Background  Dementia is a global issue, with increasing prevalence rates impacting on health services internationally. People with dementia are frequently admitted to hospital, an environment that may not be suited to their needs. While many initiatives have been developed to improve their care in the acute setting, there is a lack of cohesive understanding of how staff experience and perceive the care they give to people with dementia in the acute setting.    Objectives  The aim of this qualitative synthesis was to explore health care staffs’ experiences and perceptions of caring for people with dementia in the acute setting. Qualitative synthesis can bring together isolated findings in a meaningful way that can inform policy development.    Settings  A screening process, using inclusion/exclusion criteria, identified qualitative studies that focused on health care staff caring for people with dementia in acute settings.    Participants  Twelve reports of nine studies were included for synthesis. Data extraction was conducted on each report by two researchers.    Methods  Framework synthesis was employed using VIPS framework, using Values, Individualised, Perspective and Social and psychological as concepts to guide synthesis. The VIPS framework has previously been used for exploring approaches to caring for people with dementia. Quality appraisal was conducted using Critical Appraisal Skills Programme (CASP) and NVivo facilitated sensitivity analysis to ensure confidence in the findings.    Results  Key themes, derived from VIPS, included a number of specific subthemes that examined: infrastructure and care pathways, person-centred approaches to care, how the person interacts with their environment and other patients, and family involvement in care decisions. The synthesis identified barriers to appropriate care for the person with dementia. These include ineffective pathways of care, unsuitable environments, inadequate resources and staffing levels and lack of emphasis on education and training for staff caring for people with dementia.    Conclusions  This review has identified key issues in the care of people with dementia in the acute setting: improving pathways of care, creating suitable environments, addressing resources and staffing levels and placing emphasis on the education for staff caring for people with dementia. Recommendations are made for practice consideration, policy development and future research. Leadership is required to instil the values needed to care for this client group in an effective and personcentred way. Qualitative evidence synthesis can inform policy and in this case, recommends VIPS as a suitable framework for guiding decisions around care for people with dementia in acute settings.	infrastructure
Exploring How Well UK Coach Education Meets the Needs of Women Sports Coaches	Inclusive and equitable processes are important to the development of sports coaching.  The aim of this study was to explore how well UK coach education meets the needs of women sports coaches in order to make recommendations to further enhance the engagement of, and support for, aspiring and existing women coaches.  The national governing bodies (NGBs) of four sports (Cycling, Equestrian, Gymnastics and Rowing) volunteered to participate and semi-structured interviews using the tenants of Appreciative Inquiry (AI) within a Self Determination Theory (SDT) framework were undertaken with 23 coaches, eight coach educators and five NGB officers.  The data themed into an analytic structure derived from SDT comprising ‘Autonomy: Freedom to coach’, ‘Coaching competence’, and ‘Relatedness and belonging’.  The coaches perceived potential benefit from enhanced relatedness and belonging within their sport with the findings suggesting that NGBs should embrace coach-led decision making in terms of the developmental topics which are important and should adopt the development of competence, rather than assessing technical understanding, as the foundational principle of more inclusive coach education.  Future research should investigate the impact of the inclusive practices which are recommended within this investigation such as the softening of the technocratic focus of formal coach education.	women
The Impact of Dementia on Women Internationally: an Integrative Review	Women are disproportionately affected by dementia, both in terms of developing dementia and becoming caregivers. We conducted an integrative review of English language literature of the issues affecting women in relation to dementia from an international perspective. The majority of relevant studies were conducted in high income countries, and none were from low-income countries. The effects of caregiving on health, wellbeing and finances are greater for women; issues facing women, particularly in low and middle-income countries need to be better understood. Research should focus on building resilience to help people adjust and cope long term.	women
Do Psychosocial Interventions Improve Quality of Life and Wellbeing in Adults with Neuromuscular Disorders? A Systematic Review and Narrative Synthesis	Background: Quality of life and well-being are frequently restricted in adults with neuromuscular disorders. As such, identification of appropriate interventions is imperative. Objective: The objective of this paper was to systematically review and critically appraise quantitative studies (RCTs, controlled trials and cohort studies) of psychosocial interventions designed to improve quality of life and well-being in adults with neuromuscular disorders. Method: A systematic review of the published and unpublished literature was conducted. Studies meeting inclusion criteria were appraised using a validated quality assessment tool and results presented in a narrative synthesis. Results: Out of 3,136 studies identified, ten studies met criteria for inclusion within the review.  Included studies comprised a range of interventions including: cognitive behavioural therapy, dignity therapy, hypnosis, expressive disclosure, gratitude lists, group psychoeducation and psychologically informed rehabilitation. Five of the interventions were for patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS). The remainder were for patients with post-polio syndrome, muscular dystrophies and mixed disorders, such as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, myasthenia gravis and myotonic dystrophy. Across varied interventions and neuromuscular disorders, seven studies reported a short-term beneficial effect of intervention on quality of life and well-being. Whilst such findings are encouraging, widespread issues with the methodological quality of these studies significantly compromised the results.  Conclusion: There is no strong evidence that psychosocial interventions improve quality of life and well-being in adults with neuromuscular disorders, due to a paucity of high quality research in this field. Multi-site, randomised controlled trials with active controls, standardised outcome measurement and longer term follow-ups are urgently required.	well-being
What Attitude Changes Are Needed to Cause SMEs to Take a Strategic Approach to Information Security?	Spending on security in an SME usually has to compete with demands for hardware, infrastructure, and strategic applications. In this paper, the authors seek to explore the reasons why smaller SMEs in particular have consistently failed to see securing information as strategic year-on-year spending, and just regard as part of an overall tight IT budget. The authors scrutinise the typical SMEs reasoning for choosing to see non-spending on security as an acceptable strategic risk. They look particularly at possible reasons why SMEs tend not to take much notice of "scare stories" in the media based on research showing they are increasingly at risk, whilst larger businesses are taking greater precautions and become more difficult to penetrate. The results and their analysis provide useful pointers towards broader business environment changes that would cause SMEs to be more risk-averse and ethical in their approach to securing their own and their clients’ information.	infrastructure
Social Return on Investment: Valuing Health Outcomes or Promoting Economic Values?	Interventions and activities that influence health are often concerned with intangible outcomes that are difficult to value despite their potential significance. Social Return on Investment is an evaluation framework that explores all aspects of change and expresses these in comparable terms. It combines qualitative narratives and quantitative measurements with a financial approach to enable outcomes that can otherwise be overlooked or undervalued to be incorporated appropriately. This article presents Social Return on Investment as an effective tool for supporting the development of a holistic appreciation of how interventions impact on the health and well-being of individuals, communities and societies.	well-being
A Simple Model Describes Development of Early Peaks in Oomycete Zoospore Inoculum Detected in Southern UK Outdoors Horticultural Reservoirs	The numbers of water-borne oomycete propagules in outdoor reservoirs used in horticultural nurseries within the UK are investigated in this study. Water samples were recovered from 11 different horticultural nurseries in the southern UK during Jan-May in two ‘cool’ years (2010.and 2013; winter temperatures 2.0 and 0.4oC below UK Met Office 30 year winter average respectively) and two ‘warm’ years (2008 and 2012; winter temperatures 1.2 and 0.9oC above UK Met Office 30 year winter average respectively).  Samples were analysed for total number of oomycete colony forming units (CFU), predominantly members of the families Saprolegniaceae and Pythiaceae, and these were combined to give monthly mean counts. The numbers of CFU were investigated with respect to prevailing climate in the region: mean monthly air temperatures calculated by using daily observations from the nearest climatological station.  The investigations show that the number of CFU during spring can be explained by a linear first-order equation and a statistically significant r2 value of 0.66 with the simple relationship: [CFU] = a(T-Tb )-b, where a is the rate of inoculum development with temperature T, and b is the baseload population at temperatures below Tb.  Despite the majority of oomycete CFU detected being non-phytopathogenic members of the Saprolegniaceae, total oomycete CFU counts are still of considerable value as indicators of irrigation water treatment efficacy and cleanliness of storage tanks.  The presence/absence of Pythium spp. was also determined for all samples tested, and Pythium CFU were found to be present in the majority, the exceptions all being particularly cold months (January and February 2010 and January 2008). A simple scenario study (+2 deg C) suggests that abundance of water-borne oomycetes during spring could be affected by increased temperatures due to climate change.	climate change,water
Food for Pollinators: Quantifying the Nectar and Pollen Resources of Urban Flower Meadows	Planted meadows are increasingly used to improve the biodiversity and aesthetic amenity value of urban areas. Although many ‘pollinator-friendly’ seed mixes are available, the floral resources these provide to flower-visiting insects, and how these change through time, are largely unknown. Such data are necessary to compare the resources provided by alternative meadow seed mixes to each other and to other flowering habitats. We used quantitative surveys of over 2 million flowers to estimate the nectar and pollen resources offered by two exemplar commercial seed mixes (one annual, one perennial) and associated weeds grown as 300m2 meadows across four UK cities, sampled at six time points between May and September 2013. Nectar sugar and pollen rewards per flower varied widely across 65 species surveyed, with native British weed species (including dandelion, Taraxacum agg.) contributing the top five nectar producers and two of the top ten pollen producers. Seed mix species yielding the highest rewards per flower included Leontodon hispidus, Centaurea cyanus and C. nigra for nectar, and Papaver rhoeas, Eschscholzia californica and Malva moschata for pollen. Perennial meadows produced up to 20x more nectar and up to 6x more pollen than annual meadows, which in turn produced far more than amenity grassland controls. Perennial meadows produced resources earlier in the year than annual meadows, but both seed mixes delivered very low resource levels early in the year and these were provided almost entirely by native weeds. Pollen volume per flower is well predicted statistically by floral morphology, and nectar sugar mass and pollen volume per unit area are correlated with flower counts, raising the possibility that resource levels can be estimated for species or habitats where they cannot be measured directly. Our approach does not incorporate resource quality information (for example, pollen protein or essential amino acid content), but can easily do so when suitable data exist. Our approach should inform the design of new seed mixes to ensure continuity in floral resource availability throughout the year, and to identify suitable species to fill resource gaps in established mixes.	cities
Best Practice for Providing Social Care and Support to People Living with Concurrent Sight Loss and Dementia: Professional Perspectives	Purpose-Approximately 100,000 people in the UK aged 75 and over have concurrent dementia and sight loss, but current understanding of their experiences, needs and preferences is limited. The purpose of this paper is to report on a research project that explored the provision of social care and support for older people with both conditions. Design/methodology/approach-The project was a collaboration between the universities of York, Worcester, Bournemouth and Cambridge, supported by the Thomas Pocklington Trust and the Housing and Dementia Research Consortium. Data for this paper were drawn from focus groups held in 2013 involving 47 professionals across the dementia, sight loss and housing sectors. Findings-Thematic analysis identified five main barriers to providing high-quality, cost-effective social care and support: time constraints; financial limitations; insufficient professional knowledge; a lack of joint working; and inconsistency of services. The requirements of dementia and sight loss often conflict, which can limit the usefulness of equipment, aids and adaptations. Support and information needs to address individual needs and preferences. Research limitations/implications-Unless professionals consider dementia and sight loss together, they are unlikely to think about the impact of both conditions and the potential of their own services to provide effective support for individuals and their informal carers. Failing to consider both conditions together can also limit the availability and accessibility of social care and support services. This paper is based on input from a small sample of self-selecting professionals across three geographical regions of England. More research is needed in this area. Practical implications-There are growing numbers of people living with concurrent dementia and sight loss, many of whom wish to remain living in their own homes. There is limited awareness of the experiences and needs of this group and limited provision of appropriate services aids/adaptations. A range of measures should be implemented in order to support independence and well-being for people living with both conditions and their family carers. These include increased awareness, improved assessment, more training and greater joint working. Social implications-People living with dementia or sight loss are at high risk of social isolation, increasingly so for those with both conditions. Services that take an inclusive approach to both conditions can provide crucial opportunities for social interaction. Extra care housing has the potential to provide a supportive, community-based environment that can help residents to maintain social contact. Originality/value-This paper adds much-needed evidence to the limited existing literature, and reflects the views of diverse professionals across housing, health and social care	well-being
Exercise Training Comprising of Single 20‑s Cycle Sprints Does Not Provide a Sufficient Stimulus for Improving Maximal Aerobic Capacity in Sedentary Individuals	Purpose Sprint interval training (SIT) provides a  potent stimulus for improving maximal aerobic capacity  (V˙ O2max ), which is among the strongest markers for  future cardiovascular health and premature mortality.  Cycling-based SIT protocols involving six or more ‘all-out’  30-s Wingate sprints per training session improve V˙ O2max ,  but we have recently demonstrated that similar improvements  in V˙ O2max can be achieved with as few as two 20-s  sprints. This suggests that the volume of sprint exercise  has limited influence on subsequent training adaptations.  Therefore, the aim of the present study was to examine  whether a single 20-s cycle sprint per training session can  provide a sufficient stimulus for improving V˙ O2max.  Methods Thirty sedentary or recreationally active participants(10 men/20 women; mean ± SD age: 24 ± 6 years,  BMI: 22.6 ± 4.0 kg m−2, V˙ O2max: 33 ± 7 mL kg−1 min−1)  were randomised to a training group or a no-intervention  control group. Training involved three exercise sessions  per week for 4 weeks, consisting of a single 20-s Wingate  sprint (no warm-up or cool-down). V˙ O2max was determined  prior to training and 3 days following the final training  session.Results Mean V˙ O2max did not significantly change in the  training group (2.15 ± 0.62 vs. 2.22 ± 0.64 L min−1) or  the control group (2.07 ± 0.69 vs. 2.08 ± 0.68 L min−1;  effect of time: P = 0.17; group × time interaction effect:  P = 0.26).  Conclusion Although we have previously demonstrated  that regularly performing two repeated 20-s ‘all-out’ cycle  sprints provides a sufficient training stimulus for a robust  increase in V˙ O2max, our present study suggests that this is not the case when training sessions are limited to a single sprint.	women
Drones for River Habitat Assessment? A Report from the International Symposium on Ecohydraulics	Every two years, the International Symposium on Ecohydraulics (ISE) provides an opportunity for the exchange of knowledge, sharing  of practical experiences and collaboration between  academics and practitioners working across  the many disciplines of ecohydraulics, including  aquatic ecology, water engineering, hydraulics,  fluvial geomorphology and biogeochemistry. The  interconnectedness of these disciplines within  ecohydraulics is fundamental in addressing many of  the present challenges we face in terms of river and  water resource management.	water
Aquatic Macroinvertebrate Biodiversity Associated with Artificial Agricultural Drainage Ditches	Agricultural drainage channels and ditches are ubiquitous features in the lowland agricultural landscapes, built primarily to facilitate land drainage, irrigate agricultural crops and alleviate flood risk. Most drainage ditches are considered artificial waterbodies and are not typically included in routine monitoring programmes, and as a result the faunal and floral communities they support are poorly quantified. This paper characterizes the aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity (alpha, beta and gamma) of agricultural drainage ditches managed by an internal drainage board in Lincolnshire, UK. The drainage ditches support very diverse macroinvertebrate communities at both the site (alpha diversity) and landscape scale (gamma diversity) with the main arterial drainage ditches supporting greater numbers of taxa when compared to smaller ditches. Examination of the between site community heterogeneity (beta diversity) indicated that differences among ditches were high spatially and temporally. The results illustrate that both main arterial and side ditches make a unique contribution to aquatic biodiversity of the agricultural landscape. Given the need to maintain drainage ditches to support agriculture and flood defence measures, we advocate the application of principles from ‘reconciliation ecology’ to inform the future management and conservation of drainage ditches.	land
Air Temperature Distribution and Energy-balance Modelling of a Debris-covered Glacier	Near-surface air temperature is an important determinant of the surface energy balance of glaciers and is often represented by a constant linear temperature gradients (TGs) in models. Spatiotemporal variability in 2 m air temperature was measured across the debris-covered Miage Glacier, Italy, over an 89 d period during the 2014 ablation season using a network of 19 stations. Air temperature was found to be strongly dependent upon elevation for most stations, even under varying meteorological conditions and at different times of day, and its spatial variability was well explained by a locally derived mean linear TG (MG–TG) of −0.0088°C m−1. However, local temperature depressions occurred over areas of very thin or patchy debris cover. The MG–TG, together with other air TGs, extrapolated from both on- and off-glacier sites, were applied in a distributed energy-balance model. Compared with piecewise air temperature extrapolation from all on-glacier stations, modelled ablation, using the MG–TG, increased by <1%, increasing to >4% using the environmental ‘lapse rate’. Ice melt under thick debris was relatively insensitive to air temperature, while the effects of different temperature extrapolation methods were strongest at high elevation sites of thin and patchy debris cover.	energy
The Perceived Benefits of an Arts Project for Health and Wellbeing of Older Offenders	Background: The increasing ageing prison population is becoming a pressing issue throughout the criminal justice system.  Alongside the rising population, are a host of health and wellbeing issues that contribute to older offenders needs whilst in prison.  It has been recommended that meaningful activities can have positive effects on this population and therefore this paper uniquely reviews older offenders accounts of taking part in an arts based project, Good Vibrations, whilst imprisoned.  Objective and design: The Good Vibrations project engages individuals in Gamelan music making with an end of project performance.  This study used independent in-depth interviews to capture the voices of older offenders who took part in an art based prison project.  Analysis and Results: The interview data was analysed using thematic analysis, which highlighted themes that were consistent with other populations who have taken part in a Good Vibrations project, along with specific age relating issues of mobility, motivation, identity and wellbeing.	justice
Lay Support for Pregnant Women With Social Risk: a Randomised Controlled Trial	Objectives: We sought evidence of effectiveness of lay support to improve maternal and child outcomes in disadvantaged families.  Design: Prospective, pragmatic, individually randomised controlled trial.  Setting: 3 Maternity Trusts in West Midlands, UK. Participants: Following routine midwife systematic assessment of social risk factors, 1324 nulliparous women were assigned, using telephone randomisation, to standard maternity care, or addition of referral to a Pregnancy Outreach Worker (POW) service. Those under 16 years and teenagers recruited to the Family Nurse Partnership trial were excluded.  Interventions: POWs were trained to provide individual support and case management for the women including home visiting from randomisation to 6 weeks after birth. Standard maternity care (control) included provision for referring women with social risk factors to specialist midwifery services, available to both arms.  Main outcome measures: Primary outcomes were antenatal visits attended and Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) 8–12 weeks postpartum. Prespecified, powered, subgroup comparison was among women with 2 or more social risks. Secondary outcomes included maternal and neonatal birth outcomes; maternal self-efficacy, and mother-to-infant bonding at 8–12 weeks; child development assessment at 6 weeks, breastfeeding at 6 weeks, and immunisation uptake at 4 months, all collected from routine child health systems.  Results: Antenatal attendances were high in the standard care control and did not increase further with addition of the POW intervention (10.1 vs 10.1 (mean difference; MD) −0.00, 95% CI (95% CI −0.37 to 0.37)). In the powered subgroup of women with 2 or more social risk factors, mean EPDS (MD −0.79 (95% CI −1.56 to −0.02) was significantly better, although for all women recruited, no significant differences were seen (MD −0.59 (95% CI −1.24 to 0.06). Mother-to- infant bonding was significantly better in the intervention group for all women (MD −0.30 (95% CI −0.61 to −0.00) p=0.05), and there were no differences in other secondary outcomes. Conclusions: This trial demonstrates differences in depressive symptomatology with addition of the POW service in the powered subgroup of women with 2 or more social risk factors. Addition to existing evidence indicates benefit from lay interventions in preventing postnatal depression. This finding is important for women and their families given the known effect of maternal depression on longer term childhood outcomes.	women
Palliative Care for People with Dementia: a Literature Review	With growing numbers of people dying with, and from, dementia there is a need for professionals and health-care organisations to review the access to and provision of palliative care. This literature review has identified several key themes in relation to the person dying with dementia including: diagnosis of the dying phase, appropriate timing of referral to specialist palliative care services; ethical decisions in relation to medication and nutrition; the environment; under treatment especially, for pain relief; over and burdensome treatment interventions; carer involvement; collaborative working and advance decision making.	nutrition
Position-specific Performance Indicators that Discriminate between Successful and Unsuccessful Teams in Elite Women’s Indoor Field Hockey: Implications for Coaching	The aim of this investigation was to establish median performance profiles for the six playing positions in elite women’s indoor hockey and then identify whether these position-specific profiles could discriminate between qualifying (top four), mid-table and relegated teams in the 2011-12 England Hockey premier league.  Successful passing in relegated teams was significantly lower (p<0.008) than in mid-table and qualifying teams in four of the five outfield positions.  Furthermore, the right backs of qualifying teams demonstrated significantly fewer (p<0.008) unsuccessful passes (x̃=15.5 ±CLs 15.0 and 10.0 respectively) and interceptions (x̃=4.0 ±CLs 4.0 and 3.0 respectively) than relegated teams (x̃=19.5 ±CLs 21.0 and 17.0; x̃=7.5 ±CLs 8.0 and 6.0 respectively).  Finally, the right forwards of relegated teams demonstrated significantly fewer (p<0.008) successful interceptions (x̃=4.0 ±CLs 5.0 and 4.0 respectively) than qualifying teams (x̃=5.0 ±CLs 6.0 and 3.0 respectively) and significantly more (p<0.008) unsuccessful interceptions (x̃=5.5 ±CLs 6.0 and 4.0 respectively) than mid-table teams (x̃=3.0 ±CLs 3.0 and 2.0 respectively).  Based on these findings, coaches should adapt tactical strategies and personnel deployment accordingly to enhance the likelihood of preparing a qualifying team.  Research should build from these data to examine dribbling, pressing and patterns of play when outletting.	women
Airborne Microalgae: Insights, Opportunities and Challenges	Airborne dispersal of microalgae has largely been a blind spot in environmental biological studies because of their low concentration in the atmosphere and the technical limitations in investigating microalgae from air samples. Recent studies show that airborne microalgae can survive air transportation and interact with the environment and possibly influence their deposition rates. This minireview presents a summary of these studies and traces the possible route, step-by-step, from established ecosystems to new habitats through air transportation over a variety of geographic scales. Emission, transportation, deposition and adaptation to atmospheric stress are discussed, as well as the consequences of their dispersal on health and environment, and the state-of-the-art techniques to detect  and model airborne microalgae dispersal. More detailed studies on microalgae atmospheric-cycle, including for instance ice nucleation activity and transport simulations, are crucial for improving our understanding of microalgae ecology, identifying their interactions with the environment and preventing unwanted sanitary events or invasions.	ecosystems
Unpacking the Link Between Entrepreneurialism and Employability: an Assessment of the Relationship Between Entrepreneurial Attitudes and Likelihood of Graduate Employment in a Professional Field	Purpose  This research investigates the relationship between students’ entrepreneurial attitudes and traits and their classification of employment six months after university graduation. It aims to identify what specific attitudes and traits of entrepreneurial graduates are linked to employability in a professional or managerial field.    Design/Methodology   The research adopts a quantitative approach to measure the entrepreneurial drive of final-year undergraduate business school students and regresses this measurement against the employment level of the same students six months after their graduation. The employment classification of each respondent was classified as ‘professional/managerial’ or ‘non-professional/non-managerial’, in line with the Standard Occupational Classification (SOC) 2010.     Findings   The research found that both proactive disposition and achievement motivation were statistically linked to the likelihood of graduates being employed in a professional or managerial position six months after graduation.     Originality/Value   This research goes beyond existing literature linking entrepreneurship to employability to quantitatively examine what specific attitudes and traits can be linked to employability in recent graduates. By identifying the aspects of entrepreneurialism that have a relationship with employability, more information is available for educators who are designing entrepreneurial education programs and allows for greater focus on aspects that may be of greatest benefit to all students.	employment
Are Women’s Mate Preferences for Altruism Also Influenced by Physical Attractiveness?	Altruism plays a role in mate choice, particularly in women’s preferences, and particularly for long-term relationships. The current study analyzed how these preferences interacted with another important mate choice variable, physical attractiveness. Here, female participants were presented with photographs of men of varying levels of physical attractiveness, alongside descriptions of them behaving either altruistically or not in different scenarios. The results showed women preferred altruistic men, particularly in long-term relationships, and that this interacted with physical attractiveness such that being both attractive and altruistic made a man more desirable than just the sum of the two desirable parts. Also, being altruistic made low attractive men more desirable, but only for long-term relationships. Finally, men who were just altruistic were rated more desirable than men who were just attractive, especially for long-term relationships. Overall these findings are discussed in terms of the role of altruism in mate choice, particularly in long-term relationships and directions of future research.	women

Counselling Psychology in the United Kingdom	Counselling psychology within the UK has grown over the last three decades, adapting to many changes in the field of applied psychology, whilst remaining true to its core values and humanistic origins. The identity of counselling psychology is strongly rooted in a relational stance and applied psychology, where attention to psychological formulation is given to improve psychological functioning and well-being. This article outlines a brief history of counselling psychology in the UK, the training process, credentialing and looks at some important challenges and future directions for counselling psychology in the UK. A proportion of the members from the British Psychological Society’s division of counselling psychology (DCoP, N = 148) took part in the study. Participants provided demographic, training, employment, workplace and career pathway information obtained through an online questionnaire distributed to all DCoP members. On the whole, DCoP members are working in a variety of areas within the UK and the findings of this article contribute to the international study comparing counselling psychology across the globe.	employment,well-being
Pollen From Alder (Alnus sp.), Birch (Betula sp.) and Oak (Quercus sp.) in the UK Originate From Small Woodlands	We have analysed the pollen seasons in Worcester for the period 2005–12 for alder (Alnus), birch (Betula) and oak (Quercus) by using back trajectory calculations and produced the first detailed source maps for these three pollen types.    The study shows considerable variations in the source–receptor relationship of three of the most important tree pollen types in England with respect to allergy. Long Distance Transport is observed for Quercus and Betula but not for Alnus. The new source maps show a number of high emitting areas for Betula and Quercus, mainly near London, in the Midlands and in Wales. The production of source maps is sensitive to the used type of land cover data and how well they incorporate small woodlands. Two satellite products, Corine Land Cover and Globcover, are compared with the detailed national land cover product Land Cover Map 2007. The broad scale satellite products show either up to 50% less woody coverage or a direct misplacement of woodlands.    The Lagrangian back trajectory model, the pollen count observations and the source maps altogether suggest that small woodlands (below 25 ha) play a major role in the overall pollen load in urban areas in England.	land
Risk of Exposure to Airborne Ambrosia Pollen from Local and Distant Sources in Europe – an Example from Denmark	Background. Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. is a noxious invasive alien species in Europe. It is an important aeroallergen and millions of people are exposed to its pollen.   Objective. The main aim of this study is to show that atmospheric concentrations of Ambrosia pollen recorded in Denmark can be derived from local or more distant sources.   Methods. This was achieved by using a combination of pollen measurements, air mass trajectory calculations using the HYPLIT model and mapping all known Ambrosia locations in Denmark and relating them to land cover types.   Results. The annual pollen index recorded in Copenhagen during a 15-year period varied from a few pollen grains to more than 100. Since 2005, small quantities of Ambrosia pollen has been observed in the air every year. We have demonstrated, through a combination of Lagrangian back-trajectory calculations and atmospheric pollen measurements, that pollen arrived in Denmark via long-distance transport from centres of Ambrosia infection, such as the Pannonian Plain and Ukraine.   Combining observations with results from a local scale dispersion model show that it is possible that Ambrosia pollen could be derived from local sources identified within Denmark.   Conclusions. The high allergenic capacity of Ambrosia pollen means that only small amounts of pollen are relevant for allergy sufferers, and just a few plants will be sufficient to produce enough pollen to affect pollen allergy sufferers within a short distance from the source. It is necessary to adopt control measures to restrict Ambrosia numbers. Recommendations for the removal of all Ambrosia plants can effectively reduce the amount of local pollen, as long as the population of Ambrosia plants is small.	land
Potential Sources of Airborne Alternaria spp. spores in South-west Spain	Fungi belonging to the genus of Alternaria are recognised as being significant plant pathogens, and Alternaria allergens are one of themost important causes of respiratory allergic diseases in Europe. This study aims to provide a detailed and original analysis of Alternaria transport dynamics in Badajoz, SW Spain. This was achieved by examining daily mean and hourly observations of airborne Alternaria spores recorded during days with high airborne  concentrations of Alternaria spores (N100 s m−3) from 2009 to 2011, as well as four inventory maps of major Alternaria habitats, the overall synoptic weather situation and analysis of air mass transport using Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model and geographic information systems. Land use calculated within a radius of 100 km from Badajoz shows that crops and grasslands are potentially the most important local sources of airborne Alternaria spores recorded at the site. The results of back trajectory analysis showthat, during the examined four episodes, the two main directions where Alternaria source areas were located were: (1) SW–W; and (2) NW–NE. Regional scale and long distance transport could therefore supplement the airborne catch recorded at Badajoz with Alternaria conidia originating from sources such as crops and orchards situated in other parts of the Iberian Peninsula.	land
Relationship Between EU Membership & UK Medical Device Innovation	Thirty-eight million people contact a medical device every day in the UK. The UK has over 3000 companies employing 76 000 people in medical technology. Currently valued at £17 billion and growing at rates exceeding 6%, the UK has remained a leader in medical device innovation. Governed under the European Union (EU) Medical Device legislations, it is demonstrated that this model, and the UK's continued membership accounts to an optimal balance between safety and risk with early access to new innovation. Leaving the EU would have a detrimental effect on UK businesses where EU legislation is used for market access. With the cost of regulation increasing, and the cost of products being forced to decrease, many UK businesses will no longer find it viable to innovate and manufacture within the UK.	innovation
Creating Local Institutional Arrangements for Sustainable Wetland Socio-ecological Systems: Lessons from the ‘Striking a Balance’ Project in Malawi	Wetland socio-ecological systems provide livelihood benefits for many poor people throughout the developing world, yet their sustainable development requires local utilisation strategies that balance both environmental and development outcomes. Community-based local institutional arrangements that mediate peoples’ relationships with their environment and facilitate adaptive co-management offer one means of achieving this, and increasingly many NGOs and development practitioners have sought to integrate local institutional capacity-building into development projects. In the context of wider academic debates surrounding the long-term sustainability of externally-facilitated local institutions, this paper draws on the experiences of the three-year Striking a Balance (SAB) project in Malawi which sought to embed sustainable wetland management practices within community-based local institutional arrangements. Drawing on field data collected through participatory methods at three project sites some five years after the cessation of project activities, we examine the extent to which SAB’s local institutional capacity-building has been successful, and from this draw some lessons for externally-driven project interventions which seek win-win outcomes for people and the environment. With reference to Elinor Ostrom’s design principles for long-enduring common property resource institutions, we suggest that the observed declining effectiveness of SAB’s local institutions can be attributed to issues of stakeholder inclusiveness and representations; their sustainability was arguably compromised from their inception on account of them being nested within pre-existing, externally-driven village ‘clubs’ whose membership and decision-making was not congruent with all the wetland stakeholders within the community.	sustainability,sustainable
Growing Well-beings: the Positive Experience of Care Farms	Objectives:  Care farms enable people who are in some way vulnerable to engage with agricultural places and farming activities. This study investigates how this impacts on the health and well-being of service users and explores associated processes and outcomes.  Design:  A mixed methods design was adopted that allowed for the integration of quantitative measurements of change with qualitative descriptions of this change. A pragmatic approach provided sufficient flexibility to support the investigation of complex contexts.  Methods:  A total of 216 service users completed an initial questionnaire, and 137 (63%) of this number provided comparative data in a follow-up questionnaire. Questionnaires contained multiple choice and open-ended questions alongside standardized health and well-being measures requiring Likert-format responses. Semi-structured interviews with 33 service users allowed personal experiences to be detailed.  Results:  Statistical analysis of well-being measure scores identified significant positive relationships with the length of time people had been attending the care farm. Questionnaire and interview data presented health benefits as being enabled by the farm environment, the positive experience as supporting personal development, and associated social interactions as becoming increasingly influential as time progressed.  Conclusions:  The health and well-being outcomes that result from participating at a care farm influence multiple elements of the human condition and apply amongst vulnerable people with a wide range of personal needs. Care farms have access to a potentially unique range of resources that can support many service users in becoming happier and healthier individuals.	well-being
Case-series Evaluating a Transdiagnostic Cognitive-behavioral Treatment For Co-occurring Anxiety Disorders.	Background. Patients with anxiety disorder diagnoses commonly have more than one anxiety diagnosis. While cognitive-behavioral interventions have proven efficacy in treating single anxiety disorder diagnoses, there has been little investigation of their efficacy in treating cooccurring anxiety disorders.    Aims. To evaluate the efficacy of a transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral intervention for treating  co-occurring anxiety disorders.    Methods. An A-B single case study design (N = 6) was used to evaluate the efficacy of a 12 to 13 session modular transdiagnostic cognitive-behavioral intervention for treating co-occurring anxiety disorders across patients with at least two of the following diagnoses: GAD, Social  Phobia, Panic Disorder and/or OCD.    Results. Five of the six participants completed treatment. At post-treatment assessment the five treatment completers achieved diagnostic and symptomatic change with three participants being diagnosis free. All participants who completed treatment no longer met criteria for any  DSM-IV-TR Axis-I diagnosis at the three-month follow-up assessment, and demonstrated reliable and clinically-significant improvements in symptoms. Across the participants, statistically significant improvements from pre- to post-intervention were found on measures of anxiety,  depression and general well-being, and all improvements were maintained at three-month follow-up.    Conclusions. Results suggest that transdiagnostic cognitive behavioral interventions can be of benefit to patients with co-occurring anxiety disorders.	well-being
For the Good of the Game(?): The Legacy of the Football Trust, the Football Pools & the Dangerous Seduction of Political Promise	During the late twentieth century, the United Kingdom’s football infrastructure and spectatorship underwent transformation as successive stadia disasters heightened political and public scrutiny of the game and prompted industry change. Central to this process was the government’s formation of an independent charitable organization to oversee subsequent policy implementation and grant-aid provision to clubs for safety, crowd, and spectator requirements. This entity, which began in 1975 focusing on ground improvement, developed into the Football Trust. The Trust was funded directly by the football pools companies who ran popular low-stakes football betting enterprises. Working in association with the Pools Promoters Association (PPA), and demonstrating their social responsibility towards the game’s constituents, the pools resourced a wide array of Trust activities. Yet irrespective of government mandate, the PPA and Trust were continually confronted by political and economic obstacles that threatened the effectiveness of their arrangements. In this paper the history of the Football Trust is investigated, along with its partnership with the PPA, and its relationship with the government within the context of broader political shifts, stadia catastrophes, official inquiries, and commercial threats. It is contended that while the Trust/PPA partnership had a respectable legacy, their history afforded little protection against adverse contemporary conditions.	infrastructure
Deleterious Effects of Lard-enriched Diet on Tissues Fatty Acids Composition and Hypothalamic Insulin Actions	Altered tissue fatty acid (FA) composition may affect mechanisms involved in the control of energy homeostasis, including central insulin actions. In rats fed either standard chow or a lard-enriched chow (high in saturated/low in polyunsaturated FA, HS-LP) for eight weeks, we examined the FA composition of blood, hypothalamus, liver, and retroperitoneal, epididymal and mesenteric adipose tissues. Insulin-induced hypophagia and hypothalamic signaling were evaluated after intracerebroventricular insulin injection.    HS-LP feeding increased saturated FA content in adipose tissues and serum while it decreased polyunsaturated FA content of adipose tissues, serum, and liver. Hypothalamic C20:5n-3 and C20:3n-6 contents increased while monounsaturated FA content decreased. HS-LP rats showed hyperglycemia, impaired insulin-induced hypophagia and hypothalamic insulin signaling.    The results showed that, upon HS-LP feeding, peripheral tissues underwent potentially deleterious alterations in their FA composition, whist the hypothalamus was relatively preserved. However, hypothalamic insulin signaling and hypophagia were drastically impaired. These findings suggest that impairment of hypothalamic insulin actions by HS-LP feeding was not related to tissue FA composition.	energy

Depth Estimation of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation in Clear Water Streams Using Low-Altitude Optical Remote Sensing	UAVs and other low-altitude remote sensing platforms are proving very useful tools for remote sensing of river systems. Currently consumer grade cameras are still the most commonly used sensors for this purpose. In particular, progress is being made to obtain river bathymetry from the optical image data collected with such cameras, using the strong attenuation of light in water. No studies have yet applied this method to map submergence depth of aquatic vegetation, which has rather different reflectance characteristics from river bed substrate. This study therefore looked at the possibilities to use the optical image data to map submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) depth in shallow clear water streams. We first applied the Optimal Band Ratio Analysis method (OBRA) of Legleiter et al. (2009) to a dataset of spectral signatures from three macrophyte species in a clear water stream. The results showed that for each species the ratio of certain wavelengths were strongly associated with depth. A combined assessment of all species resulted in equally strong associations, indicating that the effect of spectral variation in vegetation is subsidiary to spectral variation due to depth changes. Strongest associations (R2-values ranging from 0.67 to 0.90 for different species) were found for combinations including one band in the near infrared (NIR) region between 825 and 925 nm and one band in the visible light region. Currently data of both high spatial and spectral resolution is not commonly available to apply the OBRA results directly to image data for SAV depth mapping. Instead a novel, low-cost data acquisition method was used to obtain six-band high spatial resolution image composites using a NIR sensitive DSLR camera. A field dataset of SAV submergence depths was used to develop regression models for the mapping of submergence depth from image pixel values. Band (combinations) providing the best performing models (R2-values up to 0.77) corresponded with the OBRA findings. A 10% error was achieved under sub-optimal data collection conditions, which indicates that the method could be suitable for many SAV mapping applications.	water
Quality of the Governing Temperature Variables in WRF in Relation to Simulation of Primary Biological Aerosols	We have evaluated three prognostic variables in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, mean daily temperature, daily maximum temperature, and daily minimum temperature using 9 months of model simulations at 36 and 12 km resolution, and compared the results with 1182 observational sites in north and central Europe. The quality of the results is then determined in the context of the governing variables used in crop science, forestry, and aerobiological models. We use the results to simulate the peak of the birch pollen season (aerobiology), growth of barley (crop science), and development of the invasive plant pathogen Hymenoscyphus pseudoalbidus (the cause of ash-dieback). The results show that the crop and aerobiological models are particularly sensitive to grid resolution and much higher quality is obtained from the 12 km simulations compared to 36 km. The results also show that the summer months have a bias, in particular for maximum and minimum temperatures, and that the low/high bias is clustered in two areas: continental and coastal influenced areas. It is suggested that the use of results from meteorological models as an input into biological models needs particular attention in the quality of the modelled surface data as well as the applied land surface modules.	land
A Meta-analysis of the Drive for Muscularity’s Relationships with Exercise, Disordered Eating, and Supplement Consumption	We examined the drive for muscularity's (DFM) relationships with exercise behaviour, disordered eating, supplement consumption, and exercise dependence in males. By searching electronic databases, manually reviewing journal tables of contents and retrieved article reference lists, and corresponding with leading researchers, we identified 77 studies. A random effects model was applied to perform analyses and we adjusted results for possible publication bias. The average effect sizes (r) the DFM had with weight training (.31), non-weight training (.11), disordered eating (.30), supplement consumption (.36), and exercise dependence (.43) were significant (P < .05). The relationship between the attitudes and behavioural subscales of the DFM Scale (r = .47) was significant (P < .001). For supplement consumption, moderator analysis indicated that r varied significantly for questionnaire type and participant status (student versus non-student, P < .01). The small to moderate relationships indicate the value of adopting theoretical perspectives allowing the examination of the DFM's role in predicting exercise and dietary behaviour within a broader psychosocial context. Most researchers have studied these relationships in isolation. The relationship between the two DFM subscales implies that the questionnaire total score may better represent a commitment to muscularity rather than a drive per se.	consumption
Where Water Wells Up From the Earth: Excavations at the Findspot of the Late Bronze Age Broadward Hoard, Shropshire	The paper begins by considering the importance of springs as a focus for votive deposits in Bronze Age Britain. This is not a new idea, but nowhere has this association been examined by excavation of one of these features. There are important lesson to be learned from such work in Scandinavia. The point is illustrated by excavation at the findspot of a famous group of Late Bronze Age weapons, the Broadward hoard, discovered in 1867. Little was known about the site where it was found or the character of the original deposit, but a study of contemporary accounts of the hoard, combined with geophysical and topographical surveys, led to small-scale excavation which showed that the deposit had most probably been buried in a pit on the edge of a spring. Other finds associated with the spring included an Early Bronze Age macehead, a Roman pot, and a variety of animal bones dating from the Saxon and medieval periods. The latest, which has a radiocarbon date in the post-medieval phase, included a wooden knife or dagger. An adjacent palaeochannel provided an important environmental sequence for this part of the English–Welsh borderland and suggests that the Late Bronze Age hoard had been deposited not far from a settlement. A nearby earthwork enclosure was associated with a clay weight which may be of similar date. Despite the limited scale of the fieldwork undertaken in 2010, it illustrates the potential of treating springs associated with finds of artefacts on the same terms as other archaeological deposits.	water
Characteristics and Trends of Selected Pollen Seasons Recorded in Parma (Northern Italy) from 1994 to 2011	This study examines variations in the start date, end date, duration, date of peak, peak value and Seasonal Pollen Index (SPI) of airborne pollen seasons recorded in Parma, Northern Italy, in relation to meteorological data (1994–2011). Pollen data were collected in the city of Parma by volumetric spore trap. The following taxa were analysed: Alnus, Ambrosia, Artemisia, Betula, Amaranthaceae, Corylus, Cupressaceae, Plantago, Platanus, Poaceae and Urticaceae. Spearman’s rank correlation tests were used to establish whether significant relationships existed between the different characteristics of the pollen seasons. Simple linear regression analysis was also carried out in order to investigate trends over time. Only 12 % of the 66 characteristics examined showed significant changes over the study period. Temperatures increased significantly during the spring, but this did not appear to have a corresponding impact on seasonal characteristics related to the timing of pollen seasons (i.e. start date, peak date and end date). All of the observed changes were associated with characteristics that can be related to exposure (i.e. duration, peak value and SPI). For arboreal taxa, the SPI of Betula decreased significantly, and Platanus pollen seasons became significantly shorter. For herbaceous species, the SPI and peak values of Artemisia became significantly lower, whereas the SPI and peak values of Ambrosia became significantly higher. The SPI of Poaceae and Urticaceae also decreased significantly. The results of correlation analysis showed that various characteristics of pollen seasons are significantly related. This study provides an essential baseline for determining exposure of the allergic population to allergenic pollen and aids understanding of the incidence of pollinosis in Parma. Gaps still exist in current knowledge; not least, the need to quantify the degree of influence exerted by some of the principal factors driving environmental change, climate and land use.	land
The WI's Rural Retailing and Markets 1915–1939: a First World War Legacy	The Women's Institute Movement was set up under the auspices of the Agricultural Organisation Society in 1915 to improve the food supply during the Great War. The Women's Institutes encouraged food saving and preservation. This article draws attention to the rural retailing opportunities and markets that were established by the WI in wartime and continued to develop in the inter-war period, assisted by grants from the Carnegie Trust in the 1930s. The WI established sales tables, depots and markets that enabled smallholders, cottage gardeners and allotment holders to find financially non-exploitative retail opportunities for their produce. Initially this produce came from their gardens, allotments and smallholdings, but in time preserves, baking craftwork, jam, cakes, toys, knitted toys and garments and even a wedding trousseau were ordered or sold through these various WI retail outlets. The markets were not restricted to WI members and often sold work produced by small­holders, the disabled and ex-servicemen. Furthermore they were seen as an example of co-operative marketing that could prove useful in preventing food waste and helping rural households to survive in wartime and later during the economic crisis of the 1930s. This article suggests that these retail opportunities were of significance to rural women as a chance to earn much needed cash and in placing a value on domestic labour. They, like the WI, were a legacy of the First World War.	women
Using Part-time Working to Support Graduate Employment: Needs and Perceptions of Employers	An exploration of the value attached to the work experience of graduates, and particularly the value of part-time working whilst studying for a degree, from an employer’s perspective, is reported. A documentary analysis of graduate recruiters was conducted to assess the extent to  which work experience was specified for graduate employment  programmes. Further interviews were then carried out with a sample of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to explore how the part-time working of graduates is perceived by employers. Work experience is deemed to be important to employers, not only as a differentiator but also as a measure of how graduates will perform in-post. Employers generally signalled the value of work experience, but indicated that graduates did not make best use of it in their job applications. It is argued that the findings will provide information to universities and educators about the  contribution and importance of students’ part-time working in terms of graduate employment prospects and with respect to the employability agenda in the HE curriculum in the UK.	employment
Ragweed (Ambrosia) Pollen Source Inventory for Austria	This study improves the spatial coverage of top-down Ambrosia pollen source inventories for Europe by expanding the methodology to Austria, a country that is challenging in terms of topography and the distribution of ragweed plants. The inventory combines annual ragweed pollen counts from 19 pollen-monitoring stations in Austria (2004–2013), 657 geographical observations of Ambrosia plants, a Digital Elevation Model (DEM), local knowledge of ragweed ecology and CORINE land cover information from the source area. The highest mean annual ragweed pollen concentrations were generally recorded in the East of Austria where the highest densities of possible growth habitats for Ambrosia were situated. Approximately 99% of all observations of Ambrosia populations were below 745 m. The European infection level varies from 0.1% at Freistadt in Northern Austria to 12.8% at Rosalia in Eastern Austria. More top-down Ambrosia pollen source inventories are required for other parts of Europe.	land
Developing Palliative Care Globally: Facing the Challenge	While at the 20th International  Congress on Palliative Care in  Montreal, Canada last September, it  became apparent to all delegates that palliative  care and its important role in caring for people  with life-limiting and threatening conditions was  not recognised globally. On close scrutiny of the  United Nations (UN) Millennium Sustainable  Development Goals for 2015-2030, it became  clear that palliative care was an obvious omission.  This seemed odd considering that HIV/  AIDS, sexual abuse, child mortality, and poverty  (to name just a few) all featured prominently in  the goals. The other oddity was that the UK, well  known as the birthplace of modern palliative  care, was one of three countries charged or  tasked by the UN to spearhead the nature and  scope of the millennium goals.	poverty,sustainable
Enhancing the Employability of Humanities Postgraduates: a Students as Academic Partners Project Report	In an increasingly competitive employment market, postgraduates need to demonstrate more than the ‘skills,   knowledge, attitudes and experiences that are closely   associated with the research process’ (Golovushkina &   Milligan, 2013: 199). Yet results indicate that Worcester   postgraduate students remain unaware of the full range of   opportunities that exist alongside postgraduate study, and   how this affects their subsequent employability. This   research, undertaken with humanities post-graduate   students at University of Worcester, aims to contribute to   discussions about how to enhance the employability of   humanities postgraduates through extra-curricular   activities. The project was implemented as a Students  -As-Partners-in-Learning-Project, using action research; the issue was identified, base-line data collected and this resulted in the creation of a postgraduate blog incorporating suggestions of possible opportunitie  s and links to relevant websites for further information. Informed by this research, the student partners then took active roles in the organization of the Women’s History Network National Conference, ‘Home Fronts: Gender, War and Conflict’, hosted at the University of Worcester in September 2014, to broaden their existing skills base and then to connect this involvement to their professional development through a group CV review. The participants’ own experiences of wider engagement can therefore illuminat  e new ways for understanding employability in relation to humanities postgraduate students.	employment,women
Accelerometer Validation of Questionnaires Used in Clinical Settings to Assess MVPA	Introduction The exercise vital sign (EVS) and General Practice Physical Activity Questionnaire (GPPAQ) are questionnaires designed for clinical settings to identify individuals who are not meeting physical activity (PA) guidelines in the United States and United Kingdom, respectively. To date, neither has been objectively validated.    Methods Subjects (N = 76) from the United States (n = 38; age, 49 ± 20 yr) and United Kingdom (n = 38; age, 43 ± 21 yr) completed a health history questionnaire, wore an accelerometer for 7 d, and then completed the EVS and GPPAQ. Accelerometry, EVS, and GPPAQ data were scored to dichotomize subjects into groups of meeting (≥150 min of moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) per week) or not meeting (<150 min of MVPA per week) the PA guidelines, and accelerometry was used as a criterion measure for comparing both questionnaires. The sensitivity and specificity of the EVS and GPPAQ were calculated to represent the ability of the questionnaires to identify subjects who did not and did meet the PA guidelines. Total MVPA accumulated in ≥10-min bouts were compared between accelerometry and the EVS using a 2 × 2 × 2 repeated measures ANOVA with one within-subjects effect (PA assessment method) and two between-subjects effects (gender and country). The alpha level was P = 0.05 for all analyses.    Results The EVS had marginally better sensitivity (59% vs 46%) and specificity (77% vs 50%) than the GPPAQ. The EVS grossly overestimated the minutes of MVPA when compared to accelerometry (P < 0.05) for all subjects, except UK women.    Conclusion In practice, the EVS and GPPAQ may not identify ∼50% of patients who should be advised to increase their PA. Therefore, physicians should advocate that all of their patients adopt an active lifestyle, including the achievement of ≥150 min of MVPA per week.	women
Biological Flora of the British Isles: Ambrosia Artemisiifolia	This account presents information on all aspects of the biology of Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (Common ragweed) that are relevant to understanding its ecology. The main topics are presented within the standard framework of the Biological Flora of the British Isles: distribution, habitat, communities, responses to biotic factors, responses to environment, structure and physiology, phenology, floral and seed characters, herbivores and disease, and history, conservation, impacts and management.    Ambrosia artemisiifolia is a monoecious, wind-pollinated, annual herb native to North America whose height varies from 10 cm to 2.5 m, according to environmental conditions. It has erect, branched stems and pinnately lobed leaves. Spike-like racemes of male capitula composed of staminate (male) florets terminate the stems, while cyme-like clusters of pistillate (female) florets are arranged in groups in the axils of main and lateral stem leaves.    Seeds require prolonged chilling to break dormancy. Following seedling emergence in spring, the rate of vegetative growth depends on temperature, but development occurs over a wide thermal range. In temperate European climates, male and female flowers are produced from summer to early autumn (July to October).  Ambrosia artemisiifolia is sensitive to freezing. Late spring frosts kill seedlings and the first autumn frosts terminate the growing season. It has a preference for dry soils of intermediate to rich nutrient level.    Ambrosia artemisiifolia was introduced into Europe with seed imports from North America in the 19th century. Since World War II, it has become widespread in temperate regions of Europe and is now abundant in open, disturbed habitats as a ruderal and agricultural weed.    Recently, the North American ragweed leaf beetle (Ophraella communa) has been detected in southern Switzerland and northern Italy. This species appears to have the capacity to substantially reduce growth and seed production of A. artemisiifolia.    In heavily infested regions of Europe, A. artemisiifolia causes substantial crop-yield losses and its copious, highly allergenic pollen creates considerable public health problems. There is a consensus among models that climate change will allow its northward and uphill spread in Europe.	climate change
Introduction to the Transforming Dementia Care in Hospitals Series	A short series of articles in Nursing Older People, starting in September, presents case study examples of the positive work achieved by trusts that participated in the RCN’s development programme to improve dementia care in acute hospitals. This introductory article reports on the independent evaluation of the programme. The programme included a launch event, development days, site visits, ongoing support by the RCN lead and carer representatives and a conference to showcase service improvements. The evaluation drew on data from a survey, the site visits, trust action plans and a range of self-assessment tools for dementia care. The findings highlight substantial progress towards programme objectives and learning outcomes and suggest that the programme provided the focus, impetus and structure for trusts to make sustainable changes. It also equipped participants with the strategies and confidence to change practice. Recommendations are made for taking the programme forward.	sustainable
Understanding Emissions of Ammonia From Buildings and the  Application of Fertilizers: an Example From Poland	A Europe-wide dynamic ammonia (NH3) emissions model has been applied for one of the large agricultural countries in Europe, and its sensitivity on the distribution of emissions among different agricultural functions was analyzed by comparing with observed ammonia concentrations and by implementing all scenarios in a chemical transport model (CTM). The results suggest that the dynamic emission model is most sensitive to emissions from animal manure, in particular how animal manure and its application on fields is connected to national regulations. To incorporate the national regulations, we obtained activity information on agricultural operations at the sub-national level for Poland, information about infrastructure on storages and current regulations on manure practice from Polish authorities. The information was implemented in the existing emission model and was connected directly with calculations from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). The model was used to calculate four emission scenarios with high spatial (5 km × 5 km) and temporal resolution (3 h) for the entire year 2010. In the four scenarios, we have compared a constant emission approach (FLAT), scenario (1) against (2) a dynamic approach based on the Europe-wide default settings (Skjøth et al., 2011, scenario DEFAULT); (3) a dynamic approach that takes into account Polish practice and less regulation compared to Denmark (POLREGUL); (4) a scenario that focuses on emissions from agricultural buildings (NOFERT). The ammonia emission was implemented into the chemical transport model FRAME (Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange) and modelled ammonia concentrations were compared with measurements. The results for an agricultural area suggest that the default setting in the dynamic model is an improvement compared to a non-dynamical emission profile. The results also show that further improvements can be obtained at a national scale by replacing the default information on manure practice with information that is connected with local practice and national regulations. Implementing a dynamical approach for simulation of ammonia emission is a reliable but challenging objective for CTM models that continue to use fixed emission profiles.	infrastructure
A Nutrition and Conditioning Intervention for Natural Bodybuilding Contest Preparation: Case Study.	Bodybuilding competitions are becoming increasingly popular. Competitors are judged on their aesthetic  appearance and usually exhibit a high level of muscularity and symmetry and low levels of body fat. Commonly used techniques to improve physique during the preparation phase before competitions include dehydration, periods of prolonged fasting, severe caloric restriction, excessive cardiovascular exercise and inappropriate use of diuretics and anabolic steroids. In contrast, this case study documents a structured nutrition and conditioning  intervention followed by a 21 year-old amateur bodybuilding competitor to improve body composition, resting and  exercise fat oxidation, and muscular strength that does not involve use of any of the above mentioned methods.  Over a 14-week period, the Athlete was provided with a scientifically designed nutrition and conditioning plan that  encouraged him to (i) consume a variety of foods; (ii) not neglect any macronutrient groups; (iii) exercise regularly  but not excessively and; (iv) incorporate rest days into his conditioning regime. This strategy resulted in a body  mass loss of 11.7 kg’s, corresponding to a 6.7 kg reduction in fat mass and a 5.0 kg reduction in fat-free mass.  Resting metabolic rate decreased from 1993 kcal/d to 1814 kcal/d, whereas resting fat oxidation increased from  0.04 g/min to 0.06 g/min. His capacity to oxidize fat during exercise increased more than two-fold from 0.24 g/min  to 0.59 g/min, while there was a near 3-fold increase in the corresponding exercise intensity that elicited the  maximal rate of fat oxidation; 21% V̇  O2max to 60% V̇ O2max. Hamstring concentric peak torque decreased (1.7 to 1.5 Nm/kg), whereas hamstring eccentric (2.0 Nm/kg to 2.9 Nm/kg), quadriceps concentric (3.4 Nm/kg to 3.7 Nm/kg) and quadriceps eccentric (4.9 Nm/kg to 5.7 Nm/kg) peak torque all increased. Psychological mood-state (BRUMS scale) was not negatively influenced by the intervention and all values relating to the Athlete’s mood-state remained below average over the course of study. This intervention shows that a structured and scientifically supported nutrition strategy can be implemented to improve parameters relevant to bodybuilding competition and importantly the health of competitors, therefore questioning the conventional practices of bodybuilding preparation.	nutrition
The Top 10 Oomycete Pathogens in Molecular Plant Pathology	Oomycetes form a deep lineage of eukaryotic organisms that includes a large number of plant pathogens that threaten natural and managed ecosystems. We undertook a survey to query the community for their ranking of plant pathogenic oomycete species based on scientific and economic importance. In total, we received 263 votes from 62 scientists in 15 countries for a total of 33 species. The Top 10 species and their ranking are: (1) Phytophthora infestans; (2, tied) Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis; (2, tied) Phytophthora ramorum; (4) Phytophthora sojae; (5) Phytophthora capsici; (6) Plasmopara viticola; (7) Phytophthora cinnamomi; (8, tied) Phytophthora parasitica; (8, tied) Pythium ultimum; and (10) Albugo candida. The article provides an introduction to these 10 taxa and a snapshot of current research. We hope that the list will serve as a benchmark for future trends in oomycete research.	ecosystems
Transition From Hospital to Home: Psychosocial Adaptation and Adjustment in Parents of Infants With Single Ventricle Heart Conditions	Aims: The study presented here retrospectively explored psychosocial adaptation and adjustment in parents going home for the first time with their infants following first stage cardiac surgery for single ventricle heart condition.  Methods: Parents, all members of Little Hearts Matter (LHM, a UK Congenital Heart Disease Charity) completed an online questionnaire which asked about family demographics, time of diagnosis, location of specialist heart centre, distance from home, discharge information, social support, parents’ feelings about going home, confidence and anxiety at the time of discharge (T0) and at the time of completing the questionnaire (T1). A non-experimental survey design was used; the questionnaire was structured so that both parents could answer the questions independently. 62 families with infants aged between 0-2 years were sent an email via LHM inviting them to complete the online questionnaire during Nov 2012. There were 22 responses (35% response rate) from 6 couples, 15 mothers and 1 father. Care had been received at 11 UK specialist cardiac centres and 1 in Australia.  Results: There were no statistically significant differences between demographic data (age, education, ethnicity, employment, living arrangements, household income) when compared against mother’s anxiety and confidence at T0 or T1; however mothers living > 100 miles away from the specialist cardiac centre were statistically significantly more anxious at discharge T0 (p = 0.025) than those living <20 miles away. Mothers whose infant had a hypoplastic left heart were statistically significantly more anxious at discharge than those whose infants had hypoplastic right heart (p=0.006) as were Fathers with a secondary school education compared to a Bachelor’s degree (p=0.031) at T0 and T1 (p=0.026). There was a statistically significant difference when comparing mothers’ anxiety levels at discharge T0 and T1 (p=<0.0005) and confidence scores at T0 and T1 (p=<0.0005) and Fathers’ anxiety levels at discharge T0 and T1 (p = <0.018).   Conclusion: This is the first study of its kind to explore parents’ psychosocial adaptation and adjustment during the transition from hospital to home following first stage cardiac surgery for single ventricle condition. The study provides new insights into transition for these parents. Implications for practice will be discussed.	employment
The Welsh Marches: Resilient Farmers? Exploring Farmers' Resilience to Extreme Weather Events in the Recent Past	In the 21st century climate change will cause a significant increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events across Europe. Investigating farmers’ resilience to extreme weather events in the past can be used to establish the inherent level of resilience farmers’ will have to respond to comparable events  in  the  future.  The  Welsh  Marches  has  experienced  a  range  of  extreme  weather  events  including: heatwaves,  flooding;  prolonged  rainfall;  and  heavy  snowfall.  To  identify  the  resilience  of  farmers  in  the Marches  farmers’  apparent  vulnerabilities,  coping  capacity,  social  capital  and  adaptive  capacity  that  have been exposed in past events are discussed. Rural isolation is identified as an exacerbating factor of farming vulnerability. Yet, this is also an apparent source of resilience as farmers are found to rely on high social capital to  assist  each  other  in  emergency  and  challenging  situations  during  extreme  weather  events.  The  paper concludes by indicating that more localised studies are required, situated within unique farming cultures. This will enable a more complete picture of farmers’ resilience across Europe to be established.	climate change
The Influence of Geology and Season on Macroinvertebrates in Belizean Streams: Implications for Tropical Bioassessment	Considerable attention has been paid to the potentially confounding effects of geological and seasonal variation on outputs from bioassessments in temperate streams, but our understanding about these influences is limited for many tropical systems. We explored variation in macroinvertebrate assemblage composition and the environmental characteristics of 3rd- to 5th-order streams in a geologically heterogeneous tropical landscape in the wet and dry seasons. Study streams drained catchments with land cover ranging from predominantly forested to agricultural land, but data indicated that distinct water-chemistry and substratum conditions associated with predominantly calcareous and silicate geologies were key determinants of macroinvertebrate assemblage composition. Most notably, calcareous streams were characterized by a relatively abundant noninsect fauna, particularly a pachychilid gastropod snail. The association between geological variation and assemblage composition was apparent during both seasons, but significant temporal variation in compositional characteristics was detected only in calcareous streams, possibly because of limited statistical power to detect change at silicate sites, or the limited extent of our temporal data. We discuss the implications of our findings for tropical bioassessment programs. Our key findings suggest that geology can be an important determinant of macroinvertebrate assemblages in tropical streams and that geological heterogeneity may influence the scale of temporal response in characteristic macroinvertebrate assemblages.	land,water
Future Premature Mortality Due to O3, Secondary Inorganic Aerosols and Primary PM in Europe — Sensitivity to Changes in Climate, Anthropogenic Emissions, Population and Building Stock	Air pollution is an important environmental factor associated with health impacts in Europe and considerable resources are used to reduce exposure to air pollution through emission reductions. These reductions will have non-linear effects on exposure due, e.g., to interactions between climate and atmospheric chemistry. By using an integrated assessment model, we quantify the effect of changes in climate, emissions and population demography on exposure and health impacts in Europe. The sensitivity to the changes is assessed by investigating the differences between the decades 2000–2009, 2050–2059 and 2080–2089. We focus on the number of premature deaths related to atmospheric ozone, Secondary Inorganic Aerosols and primary PM. For the Nordic region we furthermore include a projection on how population exposure might develop due to changes in building stock with increased energy efficiency. Reductions in emissions cause a large significant decrease in mortality, while climate effects on chemistry and emissions only affects premature mortality by a few percent. Changes in population demography lead to a larger relative increase in chronic mortality than the relative increase in population. Finally, the projected changes in building stock and infiltration rates in the Nordic indicate that this factor may be very important for assessments of population exposure in the future.	energy
Why do Women Sue?	Statistics published by the National Health Service Litigation Authority relating to ten years of maternity claims provoke a sharp intake of breath. The total value of these claims over the first decade of the 21st  century was £3,117,649,888 (NHS Litigation Authority 2012). The United Kingdom is not the only country to witness an astronomical increase in the level of litigation relating to maternity services. As far afield as Saudi Arabia  (Henary et al 2012) and the United States (Berkowitz 2011), reports are being published of the demands on maternity budgets as a result of dissatisfaction with care received during pregnancy, labour and birth.  The papers referenced above attribute adverse outcomes to negligence, misdiagnosis, surgical blunders and inefficient administration. Berkowitz(2011:7) suggests that what is needed is wholesale and whole-hearted adoption of ‘…electronic fetal monitoring [EFM] certification for all staff working on their Labor and Delivery floor, protocols for managing common clinical scenarios, simulation  drills for dealing with uncommon dangerous events, and pre-procedure checklists’.  The NHS Litigation Authority (2012:5) recommends that Trusts ‘…engage with the risk management process at all levels; provide suitable learning and training;  ensure appropriate supervision and support; have in place up-to-date protocols and guidance with which staff are familiar; learn lessons from claims’.  It is relatively easy to ensure that staff are sent on fetal heart rate (FHR) training days (although whether use of EFM produces better outcomes has, of course, never been clearly demonstrated (Alfirevic et al 2013) and that protocols for managing events during labour and birth are drawn up and even put into practice. It’s uncertain, however, whether doing so will make the problem of  maternity litigation go away. There is something ‘rotten in the state of Denmark’ that is fuelling women’s dissatisfaction and which ‘the system’ has not been able  to get its head round.	women
Bipolar Disorder, Miscarriage, and Termination	OBJECTIVES:  To compare rates of bipolar episodes following miscarriage and termination with those occurring in the postpartum period.  METHODS:  Information in relation to pregnancy and childbirth was gathered retrospectively for 1,283 women with broadly defined bipolar disorder by interview and case-notes review.  RESULTS:  Rates of mania or affective psychosis were significantly higher after full-term delivery than after termination (p < 0.001) or miscarriage (p < 0.001). Rates of non-psychotic major depression were similar following full-term deliveries, miscarriages (p = 0.362), and terminations (p = 0.301).  CONCLUSIONS:  While women with bipolar disorder and their clinicians should be aware of the possible onset of depression in the weeks following miscarriage or termination, episodes of mania or affective psychosis are less common in comparison with the high rates observed in the postpartum period.	women
Understanding Emissions of Ammonia from Buildings and Application of Fertilizers: An Example from Poland	A Europe-wide dynamic ammonia (NH3) emissions model has been applied for one of the large agricultural countries in Europe, and its sensitivity on the distribution of emissions among different agricultural functions was analyzed by comparing with observed ammonia concentrations and by implementing all scenarios in a CTM model.  The results suggest that the dynamic emission model is most sensitive to emission from animal manure, in particular how this is connected to national regulations. In contrast, the model is most robust with respect to emission from buildings and storage. To do this, we obtained activity information on agricultural operations at the sub-national level for Poland, information about infrastructure on storages and current regulations on manure practice from Polish authorities. The information was implemented in the existing emission model and was connected directly with the NWP calculations from the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-ARW). The model was used to calculate four emission scenarios with high spatial (5 km x 5 km) and temporal resolution (3h) for the entire year 2010. In the four scenarios, we have compared the European-wide default model settings against: 1) a scenario that focuses on emission from agricultural buildings, 2) the existing emission method used in WRF-Chem in Poland, and 3) a scenario that takes into account Polish infrastructure and agricultural regulations. The ammonia emission was implemented into the chemical transport model FRAME and modelled ammonia concentrations was compared with measurements. The results suggest that the default setting in the dynamic model is an improvement compared to a non-dynamical emission profile. The results also show that further improvements can be obtained on the national scale by replacing the default information on manure practice with information that is connected with local practice and national regulations. Implementing a dynamical approach for simulation of ammonia emission is a viable objective for all CTM models that continue to use fixed emission profiles.  Such models should handle ammonia emissions in a similar way to other climate dependent emissions (e.g. Biogenic Volatile Organic Compounds). Our results, compared with previous results from the DEHM and the GEOS-CHEM models, suggest that implementing dynamical approaches improves simulations in general even in areas with limited information about location of the agricultural fields, livestock and agricultural production methods such as Poland.	infrastructure
Quantifying Submerged Fluvial Topography Using Hyperspatial Resolution UAS Imagery and Structure From Motion Photogrammetry.	Quantifying the topography of rivers and their associated bedforms has been a fundamental concern of fluvial geomorphology for decades. Such data, acquired at high temporal and spatial resolutions, are increasingly in demand for process-oriented investigations of flow hydraulics, sediment dynamics and in-stream habitat. In these riverine environments, the most challenging region for topographic measurement is the wetted, submerged channel. Generally, dry bed topography and submerged bathymetry are measured using different methods and technology. This adds to the costs, logistical challenges and data processing requirements of comprehensive river surveys. However, some technologies are capable of measuring the submerged topography. Through-water photogrammetry and bathymetric LiDAR are capable of reasonably accurate measurements of channel beds in clear water. Whilst the cost of bathymetric LiDAR remains high and its resolution relatively coarse, the recent developments in photogrammetry using Structure from Motion (SfM) algorithms promise a fundamental shift in the accessibility of topographic data for a wide range of settings. Here we present results demonstrating the potential of so called SfM-photogrammetry for quantifying both exposed and submerged fluvial topography at the mesohabitat scale. We show that imagery acquired from a rotary-winged Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) can be processed in order to produce digital elevation models (DEMs) with hyperspatial resolutions (c. 0.02 m) for two different river systems over channel lengths of 50-100 m. Errors in submerged areas range from 0.016 m to 0.089 m, which can be reduced to between 0.008 m and 0.053 m with the application of a simple refraction correction. This work therefore demonstrates the potential of UAS platforms and SfM-photogrammetry as a single technique for surveying fluvial topography at the mesoscale (defined as lengths of channel from c.10 m to a few hundred metres).

Using Dietary Analysis and Habitat Selection to Inform Conservation Management of Reintroduced Great Bustards Otis tarda in an Agricultural Landscape	Capsule: Reintroduced Great Bustards achieve dietary and habitat diversity despite living in an intensive  agricultural setting.  Aims: To investigate dietary composition and habitat use of reintroduced Great Bustards Otis tarda released  in southwest England and the impact of supplemental feed on autumn dietary selection.  Methods: Faecal samples were collected from a mixed group of free-ranging bustards without (July 2012,  May, September, and November 2013) and with (October and December 2012) access to supplemental  feeds. Concurrently, diurnal land use observations were recorded for all months but September and  December. Composite monthly faecal samples were micro-histologically analysed to assess dietary  composition. Year-round landscape-level habitat use was determined using re-sightings and satellite  telemetry data for birds surviving more than 182 days post-release. Generalized linear models were  used to test for differences in habitat selection across the year, by sex and within and outside release  areas for each habitat type, and habitat diversity was quantified using the Shannon–Weaver Index.  Results: Dietary composition varied depending on plant availability and phenological stage, and  invertebrates were rarely selected. Agricultural crops – primarily oil-seed rape, mustard, barley grass,  lucerne, and barley seed – comprised the bulk of the diet, but grassland and weedy forbs were always  important secondary foods (>25%), except when provided extruded pellets. Monthly changes in habitat  use suggest sex-based habitat segregation, with females living in higher habitat diversity settings.  Grasslands were used across the year. When supplemental food was provided, it came to dominate  dietary intake.  Conclusion: Great Bustards can adapt to an intensive agricultural setting, but require unrestricted access to  adjacent grasslands. They would be best served with small-scale habitat mosaics. If supplemental foods are  to be provided to juvenile birds, quantities must be limited and the birds weaned off before dispersal to  maximize reintroduction success.	land
Inter-professional Learning: Innovation in Teaching and Learning for Pre-registration Student Nurses and Midwives	A requirement for all health care professionals is to work collaboratively in the provision of safe and effective care. However despite this students are not routinely involved in inter-professional learning, and are often taught in isolation within professional groupings.  There is added value in inter-professional teaching and learning- evident from a resource that was developed by lecturers in nursing and midwifery.  This was piloted live on an audience of pre registration nursing and midwifery students, as an mock fitness for practice hearing. Inter-professional group activities provided reflection, debate and discussion with students voting on sanctions and taking part in the panel summary and close.  Feedback from both lecturers/participants (n=8) and students (n=31) indicated this was a highly valued experience.  It is an innovative inter-professional learning resource, in pre-registration education for students in nursing and midwifery and will extend to post registration health care education.	innovation
The Contribution of Academic Scholarship to Management Development.	Purpose: This paper explores the impact of academic scholarship on the development and practice of experienced managers.    Design / Methodology: Semi-structured interviews with experienced managers, modelled on the critical incident technique. ‘Intertextuality’ and framework analysis technique are used to examine whether the use of academic scholarship is a sub-conscious phenomenon.    Findings: Experienced managers make little direct use of academic scholarship, using it only occasionally to provide retrospective confirmation of decisions or a technique they can apply. However, academic scholarship informs their practice in an indirect way, their understanding of the ‘gist’ of scholarship comprising one of many sources which they synthesise and evaluate as part of their development process.     Practical implications: Managers and management development practitioners should focus upon developing skills of synthesising the ‘gist’ of academic scholarship with other sources of data, rather than upon the detailed remembering, understanding and application of specific scholarship, and upon finding / providing the time and space for that ‘gisting’ and synthesis to take place.     Originality / Value: The paper addresses contemporary concerns about the appropriateness of the material delivered on management education programmes for management development. It is original in doing this from the perspective of experienced managers, and in using intertextual analysis to reveal not only the direct but also the indirect uses of they make of such scholarship.  The finding of the importance of understanding the ‘gist’ rather than the detail of academic theory represents a key conceptual innovation.	innovation
An Analysis of Local Wind and Air Mass Directions and Their Impact on Cladosporium Distribution Using HYSPLIT and Circular Statistics	Ecological studies that examine species-environment relationships are often limited to several meteorological parameters, i.e. mean air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, vapour pressure deficit and solar radiation. The impact of local wind, its speed and direction are less commonly investigated in aerobiological surveys mainly due to difficulties related to the employment of specific analytical tools and interpretation of their outputs. Identification of inoculum sources of economically important plant pathogens, as well as highly allergenic bioaerosols like Cladosporium species, has not been yet explored with remote sensing data and atmospheric models such as Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT). We, therefore, performed an analysis of 24 h intra-diurnal cycle of Cladosporium spp. spores from an urban site in connection with both the local wind direction and overall air mass direction computed by HYSPLIT. The observational method was a volumetric air sampler of the Hirst design with 1 h time resolution and corresponding optical detection of fungal spores with light microscopy. The atmospheric modelling was done using the on-line data set from GDAS with 1° resolution and circular statistical methods. Our results showed stronger, statistically significant correlation (p ≤ 0.05) between high Cladosporium spp. spore concentration and air mass direction compared to the local wind direction. This suggested that a large fraction of the investigated fungal spores had a regional origin and must be located more than a few kilometers away from the sampling point.	employment
Potential Impact of Climate Change on Fungal Distributions: Analysis of 2 Years of Contrasting Weather in the UK	The impact of climate change on fungal growth and spore production is less well documented than for allergenic pollen grains, although similar implications for respiratory tract diseases in humans occur. Fungal spores are commonly described as either “dry” or “wet” according to the type of weather associated with their occurrence in the air. This study examined the distribution of selected fungal spores (Alternaria spp., Cladosporium spp., Didymella spp., Epicoccum spp., Leptosphaeria spp. and rusts) occurring in the West Midlands of UK during 2 years of contrasting weather. Spore specimens were collected using a 7-day volumetric air sampler and then analysed with the aid of light microscopy. Distributions of spores were then studied using normality tests and Mann–Whitney U test, while relationships with meteorological parameters were investigated using Spearman’s rank test and angular-linear correlation for wind direction analysis. Our results showed that so-called wet spores were more sensitive to the weather changes showing statistically significant differences between the 2 years of study, in contrast to “dry” spores. We predict that in following years we will observe accelerated levels in allergenic fungal spore production as well as changes in species diversity. This study could be a starting point to revise the grouping system of fungal spores as either “dry” or “wet” types and their response to climate change	climate change
Social Exclusion: Re-examining its Conceptual Relevance to Tackling Inequality and Social Injustice	This paper rationalises the continued conceptual utility of social exclusion, and in so doing addresses the prevailing question of what to do with it.  This is relevant from social exclusion’s declining relevance in contemporary UK social policy and academia, where its consideration as a concept to explain disadvantage is being usurped by other concepts, both old and new. The paper analyses criticisms of limitations of social exclusion which have typically centred on the operationalisation of the concept, but I will argue that there are distinctive operationalisation and conceptual strengths within social exclusion which make it value-added as a concept to explain disadvantage.  Specifically, there will be an analysis of both New Labour’s and the present Coalition government’s conceptualisation of the term in policy in relation to work.The analysis highlights the significant difference that a focus on processes rather than outcomes of social exclusion can make to our understanding of inequality and social injustice, and locates this difference within an argument that social exclusion’s true applied capabilities for social justice requires a shift to a conceptualisation built on the processes that cause it in the first place. The paper acts as a rejoinder to prevailing theoretical and political thinking of the limited and diminishing value of social exclusion for tackling disadvantage.  In particular, the paper shows how social exclusion can be conceptualised to provide a critical approach to tackling inequality and social injustice, and in doing so foregrounds the truly applied capabilities of social exclusion for transforming social justice.	inequality,justice
Increasing Primary School Children’s Fruit and Vegetable Consumption: a Review of the Food Dudes Programme.	Purpose: To evaluate the evidence base of the Food Dudes healthy eating programme, specifically the short and long term effectiveness of the intervention for: a) consumption of fruit and vegetables both at school and at home and b) displacement of unhealthy snack consumption.    Design/methodology/approach: Articles were identified using Academic Search Complete, PsycARTICLES, Medline and PubMed databases for the period January 1995 to August 2013. Articles were included if they reported an empirical evaluation of the Food Dudes programme aimed at children aged between 4-11 years. Articles were included regardless of geographical location and publication type (i.e. published and ‘grey’ literature).    Findings: Six articles were included for review. Findings indicated that the programme was moderately effective in the short-term; however the long-term effectiveness of the programme is unknown. The ability of the programme to generalise to the home setting and to displace unhealthy snack foods also requires further investigation.     Originality/value: This is the first independent review of the Food Dudes programme. In light of the extensive roll out of the Food Dudes programme, an appraisal of the evidence surrounding the programme is timely. The review highlights that sustaining fruit and vegetable intake cannot be achieved through behaviour-based interventions alone and the long term maintenance of fruit and vegetable consumption requires more than the implementation of an intervention found to be effective in a controlled research environment.	consumption
The Inclusion of Forage Mixtures in the Diet of Growing Dairy Heifers: Impacts on Digestion, Energy Utilisation, and Methane Emissions	Intensive farming focusing on monoculture grass species to maximise forage production has led to a reduction in the extent and diversity of species-rich grasslands. However, plant communities with higher species number (richness) are a potential strategy for more sustainable production and mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Research has indicated the need to understand opportunities that forage mixtures can offer sustainable ruminant production systems. The objective of the two experiments reported here were to evaluate multiple species forage mixtures in comparison to ryegrass-dominant pasture, when conserved or grazed, on digestion, energy utilisation, N excretion, and methane emissions by growing 10–15 month old heifers. Experiment 1 was a 4 x 4 Latin square design with five week periods. Four forage treatments of: (1) ryegrass (control); permanent pasture with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne); (2) clover; a ryegrass:red clover (Trifolium pratense) mixture; (3) trefoil; a ryegrass:birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus) mixture; and (4) flowers; a ryegrass:wild flower mixture of predominately sorrel (Rumex acetosa), ox-eye daisy (Leucanthemum vulgare), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), knapweed (Centaurea nigra) and ribwort plantain (Plantago lanceolata), were fed as haylages to four dairy heifers. Measurements included digestibility, N excretion, and energy utilisation (including methane emissions measured in respiration chambers). Experiment 2 used 12 different dairy heifers grazing three of the same forage treatments used to make haylage in experiment 1 (ryegrass, clover and flowers) and methane emissions were estimated using the sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) tracer technique. Distribution of ryegrass to other species (dry matter (DM) basis) was approximately 70:30 (clover), 80:20 (trefoil), and 40:60 (flowers) for experiment 1. During the first and second grazing rotations (respectively) in experiment 2, perennial ryegrass accounted for 95 and 98% of DM in ryegrass, and 84 and 52% of DM in clover, with red clover accounting for almost all of the remainder. In the flowers mixture, perennial ryegrass was 52% of the DM in the first grazing rotation and only 30% in the second, with a variety of other flower species occupying the remainder. Across both experiments, compared to the forage mixtures (clover, trefoil and flowers), ryegrass had a higher crude protein (CP) content (P < 0.001, 187 vs. 115 g kg  _1 DM) and DM intake (P < 0.05, 9.0 vs. 8.1 kg day  _1). Heifers in experiment 1 fed ryegrass, compared to the forage mixtures, had greater total tract digestibility (g kg  _1) of DM (DMD; P < 0.008, 713 vs. 641) and CP (CPD, P < 0.001, 699 vs. 475), and used more intake energy (%) for body tissue deposition (P < 0.05, 2.6 vs.  _4.9). For both experiments, heifers fed flowers differed the most compared to the ryegrass control for a number of measurements. Compared to ryegrass, flowers had 40% lower CP content (P < 0.001, 113 vs. 187 g kg  _1), 18% lower DMD (P < 0.01, 585 vs. 713 g kg  _1), 42% lower CPD (P < 0.001, 407 vs. 699 g kg  _1), and 10% lower methane yield (P < 0.05, 22.6 vs. 25.1 g kg  _1 DM intake). This study has shown inclusion of flowers in forage mixtures resulted in a lower CP concentration, digestibility and intake. These differences were due in part to sward management and maturity at harvest. Further research is needed to determine how best to exploit the potential environmental benefits of forage mixtures in sustainable ruminant production systems.	energy,sustainable
Audience Responses to the Physical Appearance  of Television Newsreaders	Summary:  Women still face much greater pressure than men about their physical appearance and  body image. How they look matters, especially with regards to newsreaders and  broadcasters. In this study, we investigate the opinions of those who watch television news  in relation to the appearance of news presenters through the use of 20 semi-structured  interviews with female and male viewers and 167 questionnaires. We found that audiences  were well aware that female newsreaders may have been chosen for their appearance and  many of our respondents thought that this was rather unjust. The audience felt that male  newsreaders were credible whether they had grey hair or were young and good looking.  Where women were glamorised they were often belittled and trivialised in terms of  intelligence and abilities. We found that audiences were more interested in the actual news  than newsreaders’ appearance and some respondents wanted more diverse  representations.	women
Productivity in China Could Surge With IT Revolution	The meteoric rise of China’s internet champions, Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent, has given China the world's largest e-commerce market. However, internet penetration overall is low: most Chinese firms are not connected to the internet, and new trends such as cloud computing and 'big data' have not yet had a major impact in China. As rising labour costs erode China's competitiveness, Beijing looks to technology to enhance productivity, and is driving large-scale investments in superfast telecoms networks across the country to 'wire in' the small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that form the backbone of the economy. China is upgrading its telecoms infrastructure faster than anywhere else in the world, and is on course to become a world leader within a few years.	infrastructure
Taxi Apps Could Transform Global Transport Models.	In early June this year thousands of taxi drivers in major cities across the world staged protests against Uber, the global leader in taxi apps. Taxi hailing apps allow people to hail taxis via smart phones from people using personal vehicles. Due to their lower overheads and the absence of regulation, taxi apps such as Uber, Hailo, Lyft and Get Taxi are able to undercut traditional taxi companies and provide a better service for a lower price. The protests signalled the arrival of a new digital platform that threatens to transform inner-city transportation that has seen little innovation over the last one hundred years.	cities,innovation
Global Auto Sector Entering Innovation Renaissance.	The global automotive industry is currently investing more money in research and development (R&D) than at any other time in its 110 year history. New developments in autonomous/driverless cars, hybrid and electric vehicles and Internet-enabled automobiles, has resulted in record levels of innovation.  As if this wasn’t enough, a new form of business model innovation was announced recently when Silicon Valley entrepreneur and founder of Tesla Motors, Elon Musk, announced his intentions to adopt an `open source` platform approach in order to scale-up the future development of electric vehicles.	innovation
Vocational Rehabilitation in Early Psychosis: Cluster Randomised Trial	Background    Individual placement and support (IPS) is effective in helping patients return to work but is poorly implemented because of clinical ambivalence and fears of relapse.    Aims    To assess whether a motivational intervention (motivational interviewing) directed at clinical staff to address ambivalence about employment improved patients’ occupational outcomes.    Method    Two of four early intervention teams that already provided IPS were randomised to receive motivational interviewing training for clinicians, focused on attitudinal barriers to employment. The trial was registered with the International Standard Randomised Controlled Trial Register (ISRCTN71943786).    Results    Of 300 eligible participants, 159 consented to the research. Occupational outcomes were obtained for 134 patients (85%) at 12-month follow-up. More patients in the intervention teams than in the IPS-only teams achieved employment by 12 months (29/68 v. 12/66). A random effects logistic regression accounting for clustering by care coordinator, and adjusted for participants’ gender, ethnicity, educational and employment history and clinical status scores, confirmed superiority of the intervention (odds ratio = 4.3, 95% CI 1.5-16.6).    Conclusions    Employment outcomes were enhanced by addressing clinicians’ ambivalence about their patients returning to work.	employment
What Are the Support Needs of Men With Multiple Sclerosis, and Are They Being Met?	Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, degenerative condition of the central nervous system that can lead to high levels of disability and a range of psychological and social problems. Although considerable research exists on the experience of living with MS and the disease's psychosocial consequences, much of this has focused on women and has seldom considered the male perspective. It is possible, therefore, that men may differ from women in how they experience MS and the type of support or interventions that meet their needs.    Methods: A literature review was undertaken to identify the specific support needs of men with MS, describe current support available to men with MS, and evaluate the extent to which these needs are met by current service provision.    Results: The literature reviewed suggests that the needs of men with MS are different from those of women in terms of psychological factors such as well-being and mental health and support.    Conclusions: If interventions are to be evidence based, then health-care professionals need to take into account the needs, desires, and capabilities of men with MS to inform service development. Further research is required to explore this, both qualitatively and quantitatively, to address the gaps in the evidence base of support needs for men with MS.	well-being,women
What’s Wrong with Tombstoning and What Does This Tell Us About Responsibility for Health?	Using tombstoning (jumping from a height into water) as an example, this article claims that public health policies and health promotion tend to assess the moral status of activities following a version of health maximizing rule utilitarianism, but this does not represent common moral experience, not least because it fails to take into account the enjoyment that various health effecting habits brings and the contribution that this makes to a good life, variously defined. It is proposed that the moral status of health threatening activities should instead be defined by a version of act utilitarianism where both maximizing value and method of calculation are decided by individuals. In this account personal responsibility for health is reduced to the obligation to undertake calculations effectively, comprising of two duties; epistemic and reflective. If there is an individual epistemic duty, it is plausible to suggest that health promotion should present information in a way which facilitates it, but despite the prevalent language of autonomous choice, discussion of health promotion messages, for example, related to drinking and smoking demonstrates that this currently does not happen. Health promotion strategies should seek to encourage reflection about the harm our health effecting behaviour causes others.	water
An Investigation into the Use of Computer-based Simulation Games for Learning and Teaching in Business Management Courses	Computer-based simulation games (CSG) are a form of innovation in learning and teaching. CGS are used more pervasively in various ways such as a class activity (formative exercises) and as part of summative assessments (Leemkuil and De Jong, 2012; Zantow et al., 2005). This study investigates the current and potential use of CGS in Worcester Business School’s (WBS) Business Management undergraduate programmes. The initial survey of off-the-shelf simulation reveals that there are various categories of simulations, with each offering varying levels of complexity and learning opportunities depending on the field of study. The findings suggest that whilst there is marginal adoption of the use CSG in learning and teaching, there is significant opportunity to increase the use of CSG in enhancing learning and learner achievement, especially in Level 5 modules. The use of CSG is situational and its adoption should be undertaken on a case-by-case basis. WBS can play a major role by creating an environment that encourages and supports the use of CSG as well as other forms of innovative learning and teaching methods. Thus the key recommendation involves providing module teams further support in embedding and integrating CSG into their modules.	innovation
Are Preceptors Adequately Prepared for Their Role in Supporting Newly Qualified Staff?	Objective: The purpose of this UK based study is to ascertain the support provided to preceptors and the qualities they require to carry out their role supporting newly qualified professionals.  Design: A qualitative descriptive approach was adopted to elicit the experiences and perceptions of the preceptors  in practice.  Sample and Methods: A cross-section of 30 preceptors were randomised across 3 hospital sites within one acute  Trust. Questionnaires were distributed with a response rate of 37% (n = 11). Five preceptors participated in a  semi-structured interview (n= 5).  Findings and Discussion: The themes that emerged fromthe analysiswere lack of preparation for their role, expectations of the preceptors and howthey perceive the role and the limitations and difficulties associatedwith being a preceptor.  Conclusions: Preceptor attributes and programme approaches have been discussed in the existing literature although  guidance concerning preparation and training for the role in the UK is lesswell documented. The findings of this small scale study may be useful in planning and developing preceptorship programmes in the future to provide sustainable support to develop the preceptor as well as the preceptee.	sustainable
New Conglomerates and the Ecosystem Advantage	It is the purpose of this paper to explore the emergence of a new form of web-based company and how the new organisational form is able to access multiple-markets and industries by exploiting the benefits of a platform ecosystem business model.  Internet-based companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple were referred to as the “Gang of Four” in May, 2011, by Eric Schmidt, Executive Chairman of Google. These twenty first century companies are leading an Internet-based consumer revolution which is having a disruptive impact on a broad range of industries and markets. Using their platform-based ecosystems (Gawar, 2009), the Internet-based corporations are able to leverage these core competencies and enter industries that appear unrelated to their core businesses. This has given rise to a new form of conglomerate business model that contrasts with the Western industrial conglomerates of the 1960s and early 1970s. Most of these corporations were broken-up in the early 1980s and the remaining core businesses resorted to focused strategies. The paper also analyses why the new Internet-based firms do not follow the positioning school of strategy and seek monopolistic rents – profits arising from market power - (Porter, 1979) by locating in attractive industries. Instead, these firms leverage core competencies and achieve Ricardian economic rents (Grant, 2008) – profits arising from superior resources - through strategies of stretch and leverage (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990). By adopting a core `competency tree` configuration (Prahalad and Hamel, 1990), a core competency platform is leveraged which allows the Internet-based firms to enter multiple markets using asset-light business models. This new form of competitive advantage is based on having a superior ecosystem that uses data as the key resource instead of capital; capital being the main resource underpinning the success of the traditional Western conglomerates of the 1960s and early 1970s.	ecosystems
Nationalising Hundreds and Thousands of Women':  a Domestic Response to a National Problem	The wartime evacuee has become a symbol of the home front in World War Two. However, behind the iconic image lie more complex histories. The government evacuation scheme both encouraged and enforced many homeowners to share their private domestic space with strangers. The preparation, organisation and monitoring of this scheme led to unparalleled public interference into the private space of the home. The enforced domestic intimacy this led to resulted in the voluntary and governmental agencies becoming increasingly entangled in a complex, shifting understanding of ideas of the family, domestic labour, motherhood and the home during wartime.	women
Homogeneity in Luxury Fashion Consumption: an Exploration of Arab Women	Consumer perceptions and consumer motivations are complex and whilst it is acknowledged within literature  that heterogeneity exists, homogenous models dominate consumer behaviour research. The primary purpose of this  paper is to explore the extent to which Arab women are a homogeneous group of consumers in regard to perceptions  and motivations to consume luxury fashion goods. In particular, the paper seeks to present a critical review of luxury consumption frameworks. As part of the research design, Vigneron and Johnson’s (1999) prestige seeking  behaviour framework was selected as a means for empirical investigation. The study’s findings suggest that distinct  value perceptions of luxury fashion among Arab females are evident, that is, this group of consumers are  homogeneous in terms of prestige seeking behaviour. Homogeneity can be explained by the existence of interpersonal  motives for luxury consumption. The findings of the study highlight that Arab women, many of whom wear the  abaya ‘cloak’ when in public, seek to pursue mutual socially conforming consumption behaviours through luxury  fashion. The study has both academic and practitioner implications. Firstly, the study contributes to fulfilling a gap in consumer behaviour literature, that being, an understanding of female consumption behaviour regarding luxury goods in the Arab world. Secondly, in terms of practitioner implications, the findings support retail marketing decisions in regard to profiling distinct consumer groups of Arab females, which luxury marketers can target with discrete marketing communications.	consumption,women
Quantifying Missing Annual Emission Sources of Heavy Metals in the United Kingdom with an Atmospheric Transport Model	An atmospheric chemical transport model was adapted to simulate the concentration and deposition of heavy metals (arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, selenium, vanadium, and zinc) in the United Kingdom. The model showed that wet deposition was the most important process for the transfer of metals from the atmosphere to the land surface. The model achieved a good correlation with annually averaged measurements of metal concentrations in air. The correlation with measurements of wet deposition was less strong due to the complexity of the atmospheric processes involved in thewashout of particulatematterwhich were not fully captured by the model. The measured wet deposition and air concentration of heavy metals were significantly underestimated by the model for all metals (except vanadium) by factors between 2 and 10. These results suggest major missing sources of annual heavy metal emissions which are currently not included in the official inventory. Primary emissions were able to account for only 9%, 21%, 29%, 21%, 36%, 7% and 23% of the measured concentrations for As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn. A likely additional contribution to atmospheric heavy metal concentrations is the wind driven re-suspension of surface dust still present in the environment from the legacy of much higher historic emissions. Inclusion of two independent estimates of emissions from re-suspension in the model was found to give an improved agreement with measurements. However, an accurate estimate of the magnitude of re-suspended emissions is restricted by the lack of measurements of metal concentrations in the re-suspended surface dust layer.	land
Artificial Intelligence Will Transform Labour Markets	The jobs and employment prospects of educated white collar professionals could soon be under threat following rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI). Although artificial intelligence has been used in industry since the 1990s, its application and impact has been confined to lower level, unskilled or semi-skilled blue collar jobs. However, the declining cost of sensors and computing power (Moore’s Law), the recent digital data deluge from social networking and new ways of interacting with computers via mobile devices, has given rise to a new form of “cognitive computing”. IBM and Google have become leading players in this field. IBM’s Watson computer has overcome the notorious problem of mastering “natural language”.  Google, meanwhile, has been building on its existing huge data set by developing a world class artificial intelligence laboratory.	employment
Flexibility, Compromise and Opportunity: Students’  Perceptions of Balancing Part-time work with a Full-time  Business Degree	Amidst the growing importance of employability in higher education, this study explores and identifies the motivations behind full-time university students engaging in part-time employment during term time, how students cope with simultaneously managing the two activities and how part-time working influences their career aspirations. Semi-structured interviews are used to obtain data from a sample of 30 business degree students at a UK  university. The findings confirm previous studies, that financial necessity is a primary driver of parttime  work, but also reveal a complex set of supplementary reasons, that either satisfies a long-term vision, or a more immediate need for development or self-gratification.  Furthermore, most students compromise the longer-term benefit of study against the more immediate financial gains offered by work, resulting in an accepted lowering of  academic performance as a consequence. The majority of the students did not see a connecting opportunity between their part-time work and future career, and were uncertain  regarding future career direction.  This study extends the use of qualitative methods in this area, which is dominated by survey research, while also extending extant findings to the career aspirations of students,which is hitherto largely unexplored.	employment
The Effects of the Food Dudes Programme on Children’s Intake of Unhealthy Foods at Lunchtime	Aims: Although previous research has shown the Food Dudes programme increases children’s lunchtime fruit and vegetable consumption, research has seldom evaluated whether the intervention can decrease the consumption of high fat and sugar foods. This study is the first, independent evaluation of the Food Dudes programme to explore whether the programme could change children’s lunchtime fruit and vegetable consumption and consumption of high fat and sugar foods following the intervention and explore any relationship between these variables.  Methods: The Food Dudes programme was evaluated in 15 primary schools in the West Midlands UK (n=2,433) at baseline (pre intervention), 3 months and 12 months post intervention. Consumption was measured across five consecutive days in each school using weighed intake (school provided meals) and digital photography (home provided meals).   Results: A significant increase in the consumption of lunchtime fruit and vegetables was found at 3 months for children in the intervention schools, but only for those eating school-supplied lunches. For children consuming school meals, consumption of high fat and sugar foods for children in the intervention and control schools increased over time. No relationship was found between increases in fruit and vegetable consumption and decreased in consumption of high fat and sugar foods following the Food Dudes intervention.  Conclusions: The Food Dudes programme has a limited effect on decreasing consumption of high fat and sugar foods at lunchtime. Targeting unhealthy food consumption in addition to increasing fruit and vegetables may facilitate this. Restricted access to high fat and sugar foods may also reduce intake however this needs to be part of a multi-faceted approach to changing children’s dietary patterns involving the whole school community.	consumption
Creating the Asset Base – a Review of Literature and Policy on Housing With Care	Purpose – Appropriate housing for the growing population of older adults is becoming an international  concern. The purpose of this paper is to report on a review of UK and international literature carried out  as part of a project exploring the commissioning and delivery of social care in housing with care settings.  The paper also considers housing with care in the context of UK policy and practice.  Design/methodology/approach – The peer literature review process used a range of academic  databases as well as government and third sector web sites, drawing on relevant material in English  published from 1990 to 2012.  Findings – Findings are presented within three main themes: how care and support is provided; the role of  the built environment; and the benefits for resident well-being. The review found a paucity of literature  focusing specifically on care and support in housing with care settings, particularly in terms of how social  care is delivered, but the evidence base suggests that housing with care is in a strong position to deliver on  most if not all UK government aspirations.  Practical implications – Despite a growing literature both in the UK and internationally exploring the  characteristics and benefits of housing with care for older people, substantial gaps remain in the research  evidence.  Originality/value – This paper presents an up to date review of the housing with care literature in the  context of current UK policy.	well-being
The Patient’s Hay-fever Diary: Three Years of Results from Germany	The patient’s hay-fever diary (PHD) is a newly developed, internet-based tool for self-documentation of pollen-induced symptoms (eyes, nose and airways), general well-being and medication use. In Germany, more than 1,600 users made over 60,500 reports in 3 years (2009–2011). An analysis of these reports reveal that the nose symptom “sneezing” is the most commonly reported (3/10 of reports), followed by eye symptom “itching” and nose “blocked”. In addition, medication use follows a similar pattern every year, with tablets being the most commonly used medication type (up to 60 % of the reports made in the years 2009 and 2011). Temporal variations in overall symptoms and organ-specific symptom scores are found to be associated with atmospheric concentrations of birch and grass pollen. Data from the PHD can be analysed with the aid of various mathematical methods and may provide information about symptoms and their severity for pollen-allergic sufferers. They may also be valuable for clinical studies in immunotherapy with pollen extracts.	well-being
British Women's Experiences of Drinking Alcohol: Dynamics of Emotional Proximity and Distance.	Research on alcohol consumption suggests that friendship and peer relations are highly influential and have a decisive impact on drinking behaviours. Further, that women's friendships appear to be characterised by emotional disclosure and ‘knowing’ one another. In this paper I draw on debates around emotional intimacy, ideas of ‘closeness’ and ‘distance’ to explore how this might work when young women go out and drink alcohol. Drawing on in-depth interviews with 25 British undergraduate female students aged 18–25, this research suggests that one of the compelling appeals of alcohol is that it creates a ‘space of suspension’, whereby feelings of being both close and distant (intimate proximity) coexist, often for strategic reasons associated with security. Two themes emerged from the data: firstly that the young women had a preference for paradoxically maintaining ‘distance’ alongside ‘closeness’ with friends, and secondly, that contingencies of safety and vulnerability promoted the need for co-operation to manage risk in the night-time economy. These themes permeated relationships and became a significant dynamic in group behaviour creating a tension between functionality and friendship. This paper contributes to a growing body of work that suggests intimacy and women's friendships are complex: traditional conceptions about young women seeking intimate and close friendships need revaluating to take into consideration how ‘distance’ within groups is both desirable and negotiated, and may be facilitated through the drinking of alcohol.	consumption,women
Ragweed Pollen Source Inventory for France - the Second Largest Centre of Ambrosia in Europe	France, in particular the Rhône-Alpes region, is one of the three main centres of ragweed (Ambrosia) in Europe. The aim of this study is to develop a gridded ragweed pollen source inventory for all of France that can be used in assessments, eradication plans and by atmospheric models for describing concentrations of airborne ragweed pollen. The inventory combines information about spatial variations in annual Ambrosia pollen counts, knowledge of ragweed ecology, detailed land cover information and a Digital Elevation Model. The ragweed inventory consists of a local infection level on a scale of 0–100% (where 100% is the highest plant abundance per area in the studied region) and a European infection level between 0% and 100% (where 100% relates to the highest identified plant abundance in Europe using the same methodology) that has been distributed onto the EMEP grid with 5 km × 5 km resolution. The results of this analysis showed that some of the highest mean annual ragweed pollen concentrations were recorded at Roussillon in the Rhône-Valley. This is reflected by the inventory, where the European infection level has been estimated to reach 67.70% of the most infected areas in Europe i.e. Kecskemét in central Hungary. The inventory shows that the Rhône Valley is the most heavily infected part of France. Central France is also infected, but northern and western parts of France are much less infected. The inventory can be entered into atmospheric transport models, in combination with other components such as a phenological model and a model for daily pollen release, in order to simulate the dispersion of ragweed pollen within France as well as potential long-distance transport from France to other European countries.	land
Smart Biologics For Crop Protection in Agricultural Systems	Crop losses caused by insects, pests and pathogens remain one of the major problems in sustainable agriculture. Environmental and health concerns on overuse of pesticides, and impacts of climate change on epidemics are immediate pressing issues. In addition, breakdown of plant resistance by pathogen populations brings limitations to the genetic control of diseases. Biologics can be effective in all types of agricultural systems including organic, sustainable and conventional. Beneficial microorganisms  including Bacillus and Trichoderma species have been employed as environmentally safe biopesticides. Molecular studies and proteomics on biopesticides revealed the  nature of antibiotics, secreted enzymes and inhibitory compounds. This review focuses on the current knowledge regarding biological agents and their metabolites including  quorum-sensing molecules and volatile compounds, and how they can be used in pest and disease management programmes.	climate change,sustainable,sustainable agriculture
Trends in Atmospheric Concentrations of Weed Pollen in the Context of Recent Climate Warming in Poznań (Western Poland)	A significant increase in summer temperatures has been observed for the period 1996–2011 in Poznań, Poland. The phenological response of four weed taxa, widely represented by anemophilous species (Artemisia spp., Rumex spp. and Poaceae and Urticaceae species) to this recent climate warming has been analysed in Poznań by examining the variations in the course of airborne pollen seasons. Pollen data were collected by 7-day Hirst-type volumetric trap. Trends in pollen seasons were determined using Mann–Kendall test and Sen’s slope estimator, whereas the relationships between meteorological and aerobiological data were established by Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Significant trends in pollen data were detected. The duration of pollen seasons of all analysed taxa increased (from +2.0 days/year for Urticaceae to +3.8 days/year for Rumex), which can be attributed to a delay in pollen season end dates rather than earlier start dates. In addition, the intensity of Artemisia pollen seasons significantly decreased and correlates with mean July–September daily minimum temperatures (r = −0.644, p < 0.01). In contrast, no significant correlations were found between temperature and characteristics of Rumex pollen seasons. The results of this study show that observed shifts in weed pollen seasons in Poznań, i.e. longer duration and later end dates, might be caused by the recorded increase in summer temperature. This influence was the strongest in relation to Artemisia, which is the taxon that flowers latest in the year. The general lack of significant correlations between Rumex and Urticaceae pollen seasons and spring and/or summer temperature suggests that other factors, e.g. land use practices, could also be partially responsible for the observed shifts in pollen seasons.	land
Mood Disorders and Parity - a Clue to the Aetiology of the Postpartum Trigger	BACKGROUND:  Episodes of postpartum psychosis have been associated with first pregnancies in women with bipolar I disorder. It is unclear, however, if the effect extends to episodes at other times in relation to childbirth and to women with other mood disorders such as major depression and bipolar II disorder. This primiparity effect, which is also seen in other pregnancy related conditions such as pre-eclampsia, is a potentially important clue to the aetiology of childbirth related mood episodes.  METHODS:  Participants were interviewed and case notes reviewed. Best-estimate diagnoses were made according to DSM-IV criteria. Data on the occurrence of episodes in pregnancy and the postpartum were available on 3345 full term deliveries from 1667 participants, 934 with bipolar I disorder (BD-I), 278 with bipolar II disorder (BD-II) and 455 with recurrent major depression (RMD).  RESULTS:  Onsets of psychosis/mania within 6 weeks of childbirth were overrepresented in primiparae (p=0.007) with BD-I. Although primiparity was not associated with perinatal bipolar depression, there was an association with the onset of depression within 6 weeks in women with RMD (p=0.035). Whilst women experiencing a postpartum episode were less likely to go on to have further children, this did not account for the association with primiparity.  LIMITATIONS:  Data were collected retrospectively. Information on pharmacological treatment was not available.  CONCLUSIONS:  Primiparity is associated not only with postpartum psychosis/mania in BD-I, but also with postpartum depression in RMD. Psychosocial factors and biological differences between first and subsequent pregnancies may play a role and are candidates for examination in further studies.	women
Venous Leg Ulcers: What about Well-being?	The impact of having a leg ulcer is well-documented in terms of the pain, restrictions and psychosocial difficulties that patients experience. However, the current focus on quality of life as a patient reported outcome measure overlooks the importance of the individual’s well-being. In this article, we argue that a shift in focus from QoL to well-being will contribute to the more proactive patient centred approach to care to which we should all aspire in contemporary care settings.	well-being
Parental Provision and Children’s Consumption of Fruit and Vegetables did not Increase Following the Food Dudes Programme	Purpose - This study is based on previous research which suggests that the Dudes programme increases children’s fruit and vegetable consumption for school provided meals by assessing its effectiveness in increasing the provision and consumption of fruit and vegetables in home-provided meals.    Design/methodology/approach - Two cohorts of children participated from 6 schools in the West Midlands in the UK, one receiving the Food Dudes intervention and a matched control group who did not receive any intervention. Participants were children aged 4-7 years from 6 primary schools, 3 intervention (n=123) and 3 control schools (n=156). Parental provision and consumption of fruit and vegetables was assessed pre-intervention, then 3 and 12 months post-intervention. Consumption was measured across five consecutive days in each school using digital photography.    Findings - No significant increases in parental provision or consumption were found at 3 or 12 months for children in the intervention schools however increases were evident for children in the control group.    Research limitations/implications - Further development of the Food Dudes programme could develop ways of working with parents and children to increase awareness of what constitutes a healthy lunch.    Originality/value - This is the first independent evaluation to assess the influence of the Food Dudes programme on parental provision and children’s consumption of lunchtime fruit and vegetables.	consumption
‘Without Occupation You Don't Exist’: Occupational Engagement and Mental Illness.	In this Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) we set out to explore the meanings of work for people living with severe and enduring mental health problems. The participants were three women and seven men who were attending a mental health day centre. Data were collected through up to three depth interviews with each participant over eighteen months. The interviews were digitally recorded and transcribed verbatim. Following transcription data were analysed according to IPA principles. Two overarching themes were identified. Building and maintaining an occupational identity expressed the ways in which participants used occupations as the building blocks of an evolving identity. Most of the participants wanted to work, and participation in occupations was seen as an essential to recovery from mental ill health. Work, and other ways of belonging encapsulated the need to feel connected to others. Many of the participants envisaged working as a way of achieving this. The longitudinal nature of the study facilitated engagement with the developing narratives and exploration of the changes and consistencies in the participants’ meaning making about their occupations. Implications for understanding individuals’ occupational participation which enhances a sense of self, and promotes feelings of belonging are identified.	women
Agriculture – Who Cares? An Investigation of ‘Care Farming’ in the UK	‘Care farming’ (variously ‘green care in agriculture’, ‘farming for health’, ‘social farming’ and ‘therapeutic  agriculture’) in the UK has grown rapidly over the last five years from the low base identified by preliminary  scoping studies conducted at that time. In countries where the activity is most widely practised,  the research focus has been primarily upon the care provided by farms, leaving a paucity of knowledge  about the farms providing care. However, such care is ‘co-produced’, meaning that insights from both  agricultural geography and the geographies of care deserve to be unified. In the British context, an  agricultural perspective has seldom been applied; where done so, it has dismissed care farming as  merely ‘hobby farming’ or conceptualised it as a minor economic activity helping to diversify the farm  business and illustrating ‘multifunctionality’. Surprisingly little attention has been paid to either its  relationship with productive ‘core’ farming activities or the consequences for farmers themselves. Using  questionnaires and interviews, the express purpose of this paper is to identify and explicate the characteristics  of care farms and farmers. Analysis reveals that it is not easy to pigeon-hole care farmers  according to their age, motives, size of farm or land tenure. The paper moves on to discuss the transformative  nature of care farming on the way in which farmers live their lives. In particular, symbiotic  humaneanimal relations emerge regardless of whether livestock are kept as pets or commercial enterprises.  Also revealed is the altruistic satisfaction of farmers as they provide ethical care and see  positive changes in their service users. The paper concludes by suggesting how the multiple connections  that are found to result from the interaction of agricultural practises and care provision might be more accurately conceptualised and articulated as 'connective' agriculture.	land
Social Isolation in Older Adults and its Impact on Health	Social isolation is a complex phenomenon among older adults which can lead to numerous detrimental health conditions. With a high prevalence, and an increasing number of older persons, social isolation will impact the health, well-being, and quality of life of numerous older adults now and in the foreseeable future.   For this review, a series of literature searches of the Summon, CINAHL and Medline databases were conducted to gain understanding of what factors cause social isolation and how this impacts on health.    The findings suggest that older adults, who can manage changes within their social circumstances and stay connected socially, may experience less physical and mental health issues. However, for those older adults who struggle to cope with changes in their social circumstances, there needs to be a process of identification to recognise those who are reluctant to engage in social activities and illness preventative measures. For healthcare professionals this means early assessment of social isolation and referring at-risk individuals to available community resources or annual health screening programmes in primary care clinics. These measures could be proactive for determining which older persons have health behaviours or coping skills that place them at-risk and would serve to reduce the numerous negative health outcomes associated with social isolation.	well-being
Rapid Mapping of Urban Development from Historic Ordnance Survey Maps: an Application for Pluvial Flood Risk in Worcester	Between 2004 and 2008 the city of Worcester, UK experienced a number of pluvial flood events. The causes of this kind of flooding are the topic of ongoing research. This paper describes a study that aimed to investigate the urban development of Worcester over time in relation to the location of recorded pluvial flood incidents. A novel rapid mapping methods has been developed to derive urban development over five time periods between 1886 and 1995 from scanned Ordnance Survey historical maps. The technique compared well with manual digitization results with k-hat values ranging from 0.67 to 0.87 for the land use maps created for different time periods. The technique performed least well for the oldest map series, due to misclassification of the abundant symbols and annotation. The method will be particularly beneficial for investigation of town/city development in time over large areas. The resulting map of urban development in Worcester (scale 1:20,000) shows that almost half of the recorded pluvial flood incidents occurred in areas built up between 1956 and 1975, which contradicts local belief that an outdated (Victorian) drainage system causes most of the problems. The quality of the post World War II developments is more likely to be a source for concern.	land
Critical Education about Marriage: Combining Critical Pedagogy and Phronesis For Religious Education.	This article discusses the nature of criticality for religious education curriculum and pedagogy, with a particular focus on marriage in Hebrew Bible (Old Testament, abbreviated OT) texts. First, ‘criticality’ is defined in historical and literary terms, asking questions of what the Bible writers meant and intended. Secondly, the use of Bible texts is explored through the prism of ‘critical theory’, in which social critique particularly emphasises notions of justice, equity and democratic ‘voice’. The presence of secular Jewish thought within the Frankfurt school of social-critical thought suggests some influence from the ancient Jewish prophetic call for everyday justice. Thirdly, I explore synergies between critical theory and the Aristotelian concept of phronesis, ‘practical wisdom’ on effective living, as developed by Bent Flyvbjerg and colleagues. Through these lenses, I examine how these ideas might affect the way marriage is discussed and taught in religious education in Africa and elsewhere. Finally I discuss the broader potential for this mix of Critical Theory and phronesis for education as a whole.	justice
Three Years (2008-2010) Measurements of Atmospheric Concentrations of Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) at Station Nord, North East Greenland	Atmospheric concentrations of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been measured for the first time at Station Nord, North-East Greenland, from 2008 to 2010. The data obtained are reported here. Hexachlorobenzene (HCB), endosulfan I and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) were the predominant compounds detected in the atmosphere, followed by p,p′-DDE and dieldrin. Chlordane isomers and related compounds (trans- and cis-chlordanes, heptachlor and heptachlor epoxide, trans- and cis-nonachlor) were also detected. Atmospheric concentrations of the investigated compounds were correlated with temperature using the Clausius–Clapeyron equation in order to obtain information about their transport properties. The correlation between atmospheric concentrations and temperature was not significant for endosulfan I, γ-HCH and p,p′-DDT, which indicates that direct transport from direct sources is the dominating transport mechanism for these compounds. A significant correlation with temperature was found for all the other studied pesticides and pesticide degradation products, which indicates that re-emission of these compounds from previously contaminated surfaces is an important factor for the observed variation in concentrations. Pesticide concentrations were also correlated with sea ice cover. Concentrations of the compounds that have not been in use for decades correlated with temperature and ice cover, while concentrations of compounds still in use did not correlate with either of these parameters. These observations indicate that processes such as revolatilization from the open sea surface are important mediating factors in the dynamics of anthropogenic persistent pollutants in the Arctic environment under the expected influence of climate change processes.	climate change
Spread of Invasive Ragweed: Climate Change, Management and How to Reduce Allergy Costs	* Ragweed Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. is rapidly spreading in Europe. Its pollen is highly allergenic, with 4–5 of Europeans being sensitized. There is an urgent need to curtail the further spread to minimize allergy costs. * We simulated the spread of ragweed in Austria and southern Germany (Bavaria) until 2050 with particular emphasis on expected climate change. Using different management scenarios and levels of management effort, we analysed the potential for reducing human allergy costs, that is, expenses caused by allergies from ragweed pollen, by curtailing the accelerating spread of ragweed. We accounted for three contrasting climate assumptions: no change in temperature and moderate (annual temperature increase of 0·025 °C) and more extreme (annual temperature increase of 0·04 °C) climate change. * We found that a carefully designed management plan consisting of survey and eradication can drastically reduce the spread of ragweed. Without management, mean allergy costs for the management period (2011–2050) amount to about 290, 335 and 365 million € annually under the three climate change assumptions. * Following an optimally allocated management strategy with an annual budget of 30 million € reduces mean allergy costs by 258, 295 and 325 million € per year. Thus, the management may yield substantial savings, in particular under more extreme warming, where total savings over 40 years amount to about 12 billion €. * Synthesis and applications. Our study illustrates that management of invasive alien species has an economic benefit beside natural conservation. We provide guidance for the future management using the example of ragweed in Austria and Bavaria and show that although the species has expanded its range and abundance substantially in recent years, a well-designed and ambitious management programme still may yield substantial benefits. This is true for current climatic conditions as well as for future climate change scenarios, albeit management costs increase with a warming climate. However, possible gains are increasing in parallel. Given the scale of impacts on human health, and the substantial gains accrued from management, our results suggest that it is wise to halt further spread of ragweed.	climate change
Mobile Phones will Disrupt Global Banking Industry	The World Bank recently announced that 2.5 million adults in the world did not have access to bank accounts and therefore have no financial security. In its report on financial inclusion, the World Bank wanted to change this by providing financial access to all working-age adults by 2020. The only way this goal can be achieved is through the use of mobile devices to replace traditional banking networks and infrastructure. A similar trend is also emerging in advanced Western countries where smart phones are now being used as mobile wallets, therefore substituting services previously provided by the major retail banks.	infrastructure
Senior Managers’ Perspectives of Leading and Managing   Effective, Sustainable and Successful Partnerships	Formal and informal partnerships have become key features of education policy and practice in many countries and managing such collaborative arrangements is an important dimension of the role(s) of leaders of educational organizations. Recent research has shown both the tensions and conflict that can develop in partnerships as well as the opportunities and benefits of partnership working for organizations and individuals. This article focuses on the characteristics of partnerships that contribute to their effectiveness, sustainability and success, filling a gap in the literature on educational partnerships. The research data emanate from a qualitative study of partnership working in England. The study used a grounded approach and inductively linked characteristics of partnerships found in the partnership literature with empirical data from a case study of a subregional partnership of education and training organizations. This combined evidence is used to conceptualize partnership as a continuum of weak to strong forms of partnership and to develop a table of  characteristics which underpin such partnerships. The findings reveal the extent to which trust, networks, norms and values support effective, sustained and successful partnerships. These characteristics are differentiated and may fluctuate during the lifecourse of a partnership but remain fundamental features of partnership working and significantly contribute to the strength and effectiveness of partnerships.	sustainability,sustainable
Can a School-based Intervention Increase Children’s Fruit and Vegetable Consumption in the Home Setting?	Aims: Although previous research has shown the Food Dudes programme increases children’s fruit and vegetable consumption at school, the evidence for the effectiveness in the home setting is more equivocal. The school environment is identified as a logical setting for targeting children’s fruit and vegetable consumption however to produce sustainable changes in behaviour, it is equally important that interventions target consumption in the home setting. This study aimed to establish whether the Food Dudes intervention can influence home consumption of fruit and vegetables and the extent to which any changes in eating behaviour following the intervention were maintained in the long term.     Methods: A total of 34 children aged 4-11 years from 8 primary schools (4 intervention and 4 control) in the West Midlands, UK completed a 7 day photographic food diary at baseline (prior to the intervention), 3 month follow-up (post intervention) and 12 month follow-up.     Results: The Food Dudes programme did not influence either short or long term changes in children’s consumption of fruit and vegetables at home during weekdays or at the weekend.     Conclusions: The Food Dudes programme had no effect on changing children’s fruit and vegetable consumption in the home environment. Further development of the programme could consider how parental and home environmental factors may be combined with the principles of the Food Dudes programme to influence children’s fruit and vegetable consumption in this setting.	consumption,sustainable
`Next gen` Internet Alters Global Corporate Strategies	The Internet is now entering a new phase of innovation with billions of consumer devices, including smart phones, tablets and industrial machines, being connected to one-another using sensors, telecommunications links and Internet infrastructure. More objects are becoming embedded with sensors and gaining the ability to communicate resulting in the number of objects connected to the Internet exceeding the number of people on earth. Following on from Web 1.0 and Web 2.0 (the consumer Internet), this next generation of Internet has become known as the industrial Internet, `the Internet of things`, the `Internet of everything` and machine-to-machine or [M2M] communication. This is not only creating new business models but a range of new benefits including improved business processes and reduced costs and risks. However, there are potential drawbacks for those organisations that are not able to exploit these benefits which is referred to as the `data divide`.	infrastructure,innovation
Student and Staff Perceptions of a Vacation Research Assistantship Scheme	There is a push for universities to equip graduates with desirable employability skills and ‘hands-on' experience. This article explores the perceptions of students and staff experiences of a research assistantship scheme. Nine students from the University of Worcester were given the opportunity to work as a student vacation researcher for up to 10 weeks. This opportunity gave ‘hands-on’ experience to students to understand real world research, thereby enabling the development of academic and research skills and increasing a student’s employability. The scheme received positive feedback from both students and academic staff and was recommended as a means to enhance student’s future employment.	employment
Building a Successful Olympic Team Selection Protocol in Women’s Handball: A Case Study Examining the Benefits of Employing Reflective Practice	The sharing of applied practice offered in the current paper affords an opportunity to view how the use of reflective practice can serve as a problem-solving catalyst to a variety of issues raised during support provided to GB women’s handball within an Olympic setting. The first author was faced with a number of scenarios during her applied experiences with this team, and made use of reflective practice (RP) at various points during the support process to help make crucial decisions about what actions to take regarding her involvement in, and support with, team selection. The main scenario presented focuses on the request for the practitioner to advise on the development of an Olympic team selection protocol. The current paper presents how RP was used as a mechanism for supporting the final decisions about how best to design and execute this very sensitive process, resulting in the development of an effective protocol for Olympic team selection. The paper aims to highlight how RP can be used as a tool for practitioners to problem-solve and make sense of the information provided to them when supporting athletes in the field.	women
Public Protection? The Implication of Grayling's 'Transforming Rehabilitation' Agenda on the Safety of Women and Children	Abstract  The Coalition Government's new Transforming Rehabilitation (TR) agenda jeopardises the work undertaken with perpetrators of domestic abuse by highly skilled, qualified probation staff. Under new changes outlined by Grayling, Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice, probation clients who are assessed as posing a medium/low risk of causing harm will be assigned to private sector/voluntary organisations rather than come under the remit of the National Probation Service. This article argues that victims of domestic abuse, primarily women and children, will be placed at an increased risk of harm given this latest TR strategy. The majority of domestic abuse cases will be assessed as posing a medium risk of causing harm and will receive lower levels of intervention by a variety of disparate agencies and organisations. The Ministry of Justice states that the National Probation Service will directly manage offenders who pose a high risk of serious harm to the public, this article will argue that all perpetrators of domestic abuse should be considered as an important exception to this stance, and should remain under the auspices of Probation supervision, irrespective of statistical risk assessment, as has sex offender case management and sex offender treatment programme delivery.	justice,women

A Comparison Of Galvanic Skin Conductance and Skin Wettedness as Indicators Of Thermal Discomfort During Moderate and High Metabolic Rates.	The relationship between local thermal comfort,  local skin wettedness (wlocal) and local galvanic skin conductance (GSC) in 4 body segments during two different exercise intensities was compared in 10 males. In a balanced order, participants walked at 35% VO2max for 45 minutes (WALK) (29.0 ± 1.9°C, 29.8 ± 3.6% RH, no wind) in one test and in a separate test ran at 70% VO2max for 45 minutes (RUN) (26.2 ± 2.1°C, 31.1 ± 7.0% RH, no wind). During both tests, participants wore a loose fitting 100% polyester long sleeve top and trouser ensemble with a low resistance to heat and vapour transfer (total thermal resistance of 0.154 m2∙K∙W-1 and total water vapour resistance of 35.9 m2∙Pa∙W-1). wlocal, change from baseline in GSC (ΔGSC) and local thermal comfort were recorded every 5 minutes. The results suggest that both wlocal and ΔGSC are strong predictors of thermal comfort during the WALK when sweat production is low and thermal discomfort minimal (r2>0.78 and r2>0.71, respectively). Interestingly, during the RUN wlocal plateaued at ~0.6-0.8 due to the high sweat production, whilst ΔGSC gradually increased throughout the experiment. ΔGSC had a similar  relationship with thermal comfort to wlocal during the RUN (r2>0.95 and r2>0.94, respectively). Despite the strength of these relationships, the ability of wlocal to predict local thermal comfort accurately dramatically reduces in the exponential part of the curve. In a situation of uncompensated heat stress such as high metabolic rate in hot climate, where sweat production is high, ΔGSC shows to be a better predictor of local thermal comfort than wlocal. The wlocal data shows regional differences in the threshold which triggers local discomfort during the WALK than RUN; lower values are found for upper arms (0.22 ± 0.03  and 0.28 ±0.22) and upper legs (0.22 ± 0.11 and 0.22 ±0.10), higher values for upper back (0.30 ± 0.12and 0.36 ±0.10) and chest (0.27 ± 0.10and 0.39 ±0.32), respectively. However, no regional differences in the threshold of discomfort are found in the ∆GSC data. Instead, the data suggests that the degree of discomfort experienced appears to be related to the amount of sweat within and around the skin (as indirectly measured by ΔGSC) at each body site.	water
The Impact of School Leadership on Parental Engagement: a Study of Inclusion and Cohesion	This article focuses on the role played by principals in enhancing parental involvement in primary schools. The schools involved in this research were characterised by a high presence of ethnic minority children and were located in a neighbourhood of low social and economic status in the Midlands region of the United Kingdom. Qualitative methods were employed in order to explore the influence of strong leadership on engagement of the parents. The study spanned a period of four years, giving an opportunity to examine sustainability of the activities introduced by the principals and staff. The findings reported are based on data collected from an Infant and Junior School involved in a number of extra-curricular and curriculum-enhancing projects. It argues that strong leadership fosters engagement of parents in school activities and thus academic achievement of pupils improved over time. The findings bring evidence that the role of the school principal is crucial in the introduction, implementation and sustainability of solutions focused on parental involvement, as well as bringing benefits to the social cohesion of the local community.

Do Urban Canyons Influence Street Level Grass Pollen Concentrations	In epidemiological studies, outdoor exposure to pollen is typically estimated using rooftop monitoring station data, whilst exposure overwhelmingly occurs at street level. In this study the relationship between street level and roof level grass pollen concentrations was investigated for city centre street canyon environments in Aarhus, Denmark, and London, UK, during the grass pollen seasons of 2010 and 2011 respectively. For the period mid-day to late evening, street level concentrations in both cities tended to be lower than roof-level concentrations, though this difference was found to be statistically significant only in London. The ratio of street/roof level concentrations was compared with temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and solar radiation. Results indicated that the concentration ratio responds to wind direction with respect to relative canyon orientation and local source distribution. In the London study, an increase in relative humidity was linked to a significant decrease in street/roof level concentration ratio, and a possible causative mechanism involving moisture mediated pollen grain buoyancy is proposed. Relationships with the other weather variables were not found to be significant in either location. These results suggest a tendency for monitoring station data to overestimate exposure in the canyon environment.	cities
Optical Remote Sensing of Submerged Aquatic Vegetation: Opportunities for Shallow Clearwater Streams	Remote sensing has rarely been used as a tool to map and monitor submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)  in rivers, due to a combination of insufficient spatial resolution of available image data and strong attenuation  of light in water through absorption and scattering. The latter process reduces the possibility to  use spectral reflectance information to accurately classify submerged species. However, increasing availability  of very high resolution (VHR) image data may enable the use of shape and texture features to help  discriminate between species by taking an object based image analysis (OBIA) approach, and overcome  some of the present limitations.  This study aimed to investigate the possibility of using optical remote sensing for the detection and  mapping of SAV. It firstly looked at the possibilities to discriminate submerged macrophyte species based  on spectral information only. Reflectance spectra of three macrophyte species were measured in situ  across a range of submergence depths. The results showed that water depth will be a limiting factor  for the classification of species from remote sensing images. Only Spiked Water Milfoil (Myriophyllum  spicatum) was indicated as spectrally distinct through ANOVA analysis, but subsequent Jeffries–Matusita  distance analysis did not confirm this. In particular Water Crowfoot (Ranunculus fluitans) and Pondweed  (Potamogeton pectinatus) could not be discriminated at 95% significance level. Spectral separability of  these two species was also not possible without the effect of an overlying water column.  Secondly, the possibility to improve species discrimination, using spatial and textural information was  investigated for the same SAV species. VHR image data was acquired with a Near Infrared (NIR) sensitive  DSLR camera from four different heights including a telescopic pole and a Helikite UAS. The results show  that shape and texture information can improve the detection of the spectrally similar Pondweed and  Water Crowfoot from VHR image data. The best performing feature ‘length/width ratio of sub-objects’  was obtained through expert knowledge. All of the shape and texture based features performed better  at species differentiation than the spectrally based features.  In conclusion this study has shown that there is considerable potential for the combination of VHR  data and OBIA to map SAV in shallow stream environments, which can benefit species monitoring and  management.	water
Ammonia emissions from deciduous forest after leaf fall	The understanding of biochemical feedback mechanisms in the climate system is lacking knowledge in relation to bi-directional ammonia (NH3) exchange between natural ecosystems and the atmosphere. We therefore study the atmospheric NH3 fluxes during a 25-day period during autumn 2010 (21 October to 15 November) for the Danish beech forest Lille Bøgeskov to address the hypothesis that NH3 emissions occur from deciduous forests in relation to leaf fall. This is accomplished by using observations of vegetation status, NH3 fluxes and model calculations. Vegetation status was observed using plant area index (PAI) and leaf area index (LAI). NH3 fluxes were measured using the relaxed eddy accumulation (REA) method. The REA-based NH3 concentrations were compared to NH3 denuder measurements. Model calculations of the atmospheric NH3 concentration were obtained with the Danish Ammonia MOdelling System (DAMOS). The relative contribution from the forest components to the atmospheric NH3 flux was assessed using a simple two-layer bi-directional canopy compensation point model. A total of 57.7% of the fluxes measured showed emission and 19.5% showed deposition. A clear tendency of the flux going from deposition of −0.25 ± 0.30 μg NH3-N m−2 s−1 to emission of up to 0.67 ± 0.28 μg NH3-N m−2 s−1 throughout the measurement period was found. In the leaf fall period (23 October to 8 November), an increase in the atmospheric NH3 concentrations was related to the increasing forest NH3 flux. Following leaf fall, the magnitude and temporal structure of the measured NH3 emission fluxes could be adequately reproduced with the bi-directional resistance model; it suggested the forest ground layer (soil and litter) to be the main contributing component to the NH3 emissions. The modelled concentration from DAMOS fits well the measured concentrations before leaf fall, but during and after leaf fall, the modelled concentrations are too low. The results indicate that the missing contribution to atmospheric NH3 concentration from vegetative surfaces related to leaf fall are of a relatively large magnitude. We therefore conclude that emissions from deciduous forests are important to include in model calculations of atmospheric NH3 for forest ecosystems. Finally, diurnal variations in the measured NH3 concentrations were related to meteorological conditions, forest phenology and the spatial distribution of local anthropogenic NH3 sources. This suggests that an accurate description of ammonia fluxes over forest ecosystems requires a dynamic description of atmospheric and vegetation processes.	ecosystems
An extension of the beneﬁt segmentation base for  the consumption of organic foods: A time perspective	Beneﬁt segmentation is a long-standing marketing approach that emphasises the ‘what’ and ‘how’ dimensions of consumer beneﬁts; that is, what beneﬁts consumers perceive in product/service consumption, and how such beneﬁts are perceived. This research proposes a fresh time-based approach to beneﬁt segmentation – namely, focusing on the ‘when’ element or when in time beneﬁts take effect. Drawing upon a survey of UK consumers, it explains and discusses consumption motivations through examining antecedents  of temporally dominated beneﬁts in application to organic food. Speciﬁcally, the study investigates why some consumers predominantly seek present-based beneﬁts vis-à-vis future-based beneﬁts or vice versa in organic food purchase  and consumption behaviour. Using correlation and regression analyses, the research ﬁndings establish signiﬁcant associations of level of involvement, prior knowledge level, and product usage level, and some association of time  orientation with the temporally emphasised consumption beneﬁts consumers ultimately pursue. Overall, the research highlights the added contribution of a time perspective in a beneﬁt segmentation approach which can assist marketers  in understanding better and communicating more effectively with consumers through drawing up consumer proﬁles based on when in time their dominantly pursued beneﬁt for an offering is perceived to take effect.	consumption
Variation in Microbial Communities Colonizing Horticultural Slow Sand Filter Beds: Implications for Filter Function	The effect of microbial colonization on the function and rejuvenation of slow sand filters was investigated using culture-independent profiling. Colonization resulted in significant reduction in filter pore size, which may be important in order to fully remove pathogens, but was not associated with a specific microbial component. Communities were highly variable, and no common microbial groups were found in effective filters. Bacterial community composition was affected by sand particle size, although high levels of microbial turnover during filter maturation suggested that this was unlikely to have a major influence on community composition. The composition of microbial inoculum from a previous filter could not be maintained through a cycle of culture, storage and re-culture. Furthermore, no significant proportion of the inoculum persisted in filter maturity, and no advantages in terms of time to filter maturation or final filter efficiency were evident. These results may explain why filtration is such an effective and robust water treatment and emphasize the need for further research on the mechanisms involved in pathogen elimination.	water
Contraception: a Guide for Midwives.	Women will generally spend more of their reproductive lifetime preventing pregnancy than experiencing it. The choice of contraceptive methods can be confusing for women, each one having its own set of advantages and disadvantages. For new mothers, a method of contraception is important if a reasonable gap between pregnancies is the desired outcome. Given that ovulation can resume four weeks following childbirth, midwives have a clear role in the provision of up to date contraceptive health advice to women, including the availability of emergency contraception. Midwives, especially those working in the community, also need to be familiar with the range of contraceptive health clinics in their locality, together with a working knowledge of the various services offered by them.	women
Towards a climate-dependent paradigm of ammonia emission and deposition	Existing descriptions of bi-directional ammonia (NH3) land–atmosphere exchange incorporate temperature and moisture controls, and are beginning to be used in regional chemical transport models. However, such models have typically applied simpler emission factors to upscale the main NH3 emission terms. While this approach has successfully simulated the main spatial patterns on local to global scales, it fails to address the environment- and climate-dependence of emissions. To handle these issues, we outline the basis for a new modelling paradigm where both NH3 emissions and deposition are calculated online according to diurnal, seasonal and spatial differences in meteorology. We show how measurements reveal a strong, but complex pattern of climatic dependence, which is increasingly being characterized using ground-based NH3 monitoring and satellite observations, while advances in process-based modelling are illustrated for agricultural and natural sources, including a global application for seabird colonies. A future architecture for NH3 emission–deposition modelling is proposed that integrates the spatio-temporal interactions, and provides the necessary foundation to assess the consequences of climate change. Based on available measurements, a first empirical estimate  suggests that 58C warming would increase emissions by 42  per cent (28–67%). Together with increased anthropogenic  activity, global NH3 emissions may increase from 65  (45–85) Tg N in 2008 to reach 132 (89–179) Tg by 2100.	climate change,land
Character and Impact of Social Innovation in Higher Education.	This article offers a strategic multi-layered model for assessing the character and impact of social innovation in higher education connecting social and economic benefit. Whilst research to date has recognised the varying importance of the social and economic benefit of social and technological innovation, the literature is mostly silent on the contribution of purpose and strategy in achieving effective social innovation or how a regionally embedded university can maximise its impact in its community and the wider society. Whilst technological innovation is a critical component of future economic growth, social innovation is equally important in building social capital and in improving life chances. Governments have widely recognised that a university provides economic, environmental and cultural benefits to its community and, critically, should play a central role in re-balancing the economy of a community under stress and promoting growth in one that is prosperous. In the absence of well-documented, convincing examples of such re-balancing, this article offers a case study of The Hive, the first combined University and Public Library in Europe, an example of a strategic approach to social innovation in higher education that is bringing current and potential social and economic benefit to the community in which it is located.  A measure of impact is proposed that is multi-layered and reflects the range of qualitative and quantitative impacts of social innovation. This paper has value to all those concerned to identify, plan and maximise the beneficial impact of social innovation in higher education institutions both on their economies and their communities.	economic growth,innovation
The Role of Community Centre-based Arts, Leisure and Social Activities in Promoting Adult Well-being and Healthy Lifestyles	Developed countries are experiencing high levels of mental and physical illness associated with long term health conditions, unhealthy lifestyles and an ageing population. Given the limited capacity of the formal health care sector to address these public health issues, attention is turning to the role of agencies active in civil society. This paper sought to evaluate the associations between participation in community centre activities, the psycho-social wellbeing and health related behaviours. This was based on an evaluation of the South West Well-being programme involving ten organisations delivering leisure, exercise, cooking, befriending, arts and crafts activities. The evaluation consisted of a before-and-after study with 687 adults. The results showed positive changes in self-reported general health, mental health, personal and social well-being. Positive changes were associated with diet and physical activity. Some activities were different in their outcomes—especially in cases where group activities were combined with one-to-one support. The results suggest that community centre activities of this nature offer benefits that are generically supportive of health behaviour changes. Such initiatives can perform an important role in supporting the health improvement objectives of formal health care services. For commissioners and partner agencies, accessibility and participation are attractive features that are particularly pertinent to the current public health context.	well-being
Influence of Different Performance Levels on Pacing Strategy During the Women's World Championship Marathon Race.	Purpose  To analyse pacing strategies displayed by athletes achieving differing levels of performance during an elite level marathon race.   Methods  Competitors in the 2009 IAAF Women’s Marathon Championship were split into Groups 1, 2, 3, and 4 comprising the first, second, third, and fourth 25% of finishers respectively. Final, intermediate, and personal best (PB) times of finishers were converted to mean speeds, and relative speed (% of PB speed) was calculated for intermediate segments.    Results  Mean PB speed decreased from Group 1 to 4 and speed maintained in the race was 98.5 + 1.8%, 97.4 + 3.2%, 95.0 + 3.1% and 92.4 + 4.4% of PB speed for Groups 1-4 respectively.  Group 1 was fastest in all segments and differences in speed between groups increased throughout the race.  Group 1 ran at lower relative speeds than other groups for the first two 5 km segments, but higher relative speeds after 35km. Significant differences (P<0.01) in the percentage of PB speed maintained were observed between Groups 1 and 4, and 2 and 4 in all segments after 20 km, and Groups 3 and 4 from 20-25 km and 30-35 km.  Conclusions  Group 1 athletes achieved superior finishing times relative to their PB than athletes in other Groups who selected unsustainable initial speeds resulting in subsequent significant losses of speed.  It is suggested that psychological factors specific to a major competitive event influenced decision making by athletes and poor decisions resulted in final performances inferior to those expected based on PB times.	women
A Comprehensive Emission Inventory of Bbiogenic Volatile Organic Compounds in Europe: Improved Seasonality and Land-cover	Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) emitted from vegetation are important for the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) in the atmosphere. Therefore, BVOC emission are an important input for air quality models. To model these emissions with high spatial resolution, the accuracy of the underlying vegetation inventory is crucial. We present a BVOC emission model that accommodates different vegetation inventories and uses satellite-based measurements of greenness instead of pre-defined vegetation periods. This approach to seasonality implicitly treats effects caused by water or nutrient availability, altitude and latitude on a plant stand. Additionally, we test the influence of proposed seasonal variability in enzyme activity on BVOC emissions. In its present setup, the emission model calculates hourly emissions of isoprene, monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes and the oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOC) methanol, formaldehyde, formic acid, ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone and acetic acid. In this study, emissions based on three different vegetation inventories are compared with each other and diurnal and seasonal variations in Europe are investigated for the year 2006. Two of these vegetation inventories require information on tree-cover as an input. We compare three different land-cover inventories (USGS GLCC, GLC2000 and Globcover 2.2) with respect to tree-cover. The often-used USGS GLCC land-cover inventory leads to a severe reduction of BVOC emissions due to a potential miss-attribution of broad-leaved trees and reduced tree-cover compared to the two other land-cover inventories. To account for uncertainties in the land-cover classification, we introduce land-cover correction factors for each relevant land-use category to adjust the tree-cover. The results are very sensitive to these factors within the plausible range. For June 2006, total monthly BVOC emissions decreased up to −27% with minimal and increased up to +71% with maximal factors, while in January 2006, the changes in monthly BVOC emissions were −54 and +56% with minimal and maximal factors, respectively. The new seasonality approach leads to a reduction in the annual emissions compared with non-adjusted data. The strongest reduction occurs in OVOC (up to −32 %), the weakest in isoprene (as little as −19 %). If also enzyme seasonality is taken into account, however, isoprene reacts with the steepest decrease of annual emissions, which are reduced by −44% to −49 %, annual emissions of monoterpenes reduce between −30 and −35 %. The sensitivity of the model to changes in temperature depends on the climatic zone but not on the vegetation inventory. The sensitivity is higher for temperature increases of 3K (+31% to +64 %) than decreases by the same amount (−20 to −35 %). The climatic zones “Cold except summer” and “arid” are most sensitive to temperature changes in January for isoprene and monoterpenes, respectively, while in June, “polar” is most sensitive to temperature for both isoprene and monoterpenes. Our model predicts the oxygenated volatile organic compounds to be the most abundant fraction of the annual European emissions (3571–5328 Gg yr−1), followed by monoterpenes (2964–4124 Gg yr−1), isoprene (1450–2650 Gg yr−1) and sesquiterpenes (150–257 Gg yr−1). We find regions with high isoprene emissions (most notably the Iberian Peninsula), but overall, oxygenated VOC dominate with 43–45% (depending on the vegetation inventory) contribution to the total annual BVOC emissions in Europe. Isoprene contributes between 18–21 %, monoterpenes 33–36% and sesquiterpenes contribute 1–2 %.We compare the concentrations of biogenic species simulated by an air quality model with measurements of isoprene and monoterpenes in Hohenpeissenberg (Germany) for both summer and winter. The agreement between observed and modelled concentrations is better in summer than in winter. This can partly be explained with the difficulty to model weather conditions in winter accurately, but also with the increased anthropogenic influence on the concentrations of BVOC compounds in winter. Our results suggest that land-cover inventories used to derive tree-cover must be chosen with care. Also, uncertainties in the classification of land-cover pixels must be taken into account and remain high. This problem must be addressed together with the remote sensing community. Our new approach using a greenness index for addressing seasonality of vegetation can be implemented easily in existing models. The importance of OVOC for air quality should be more deeply addressed by future studies, especially in smog chambers. Also, the fate of BVOC from the dominant region of the Iberian Peninsula should be studied more in detail.	land,water
Assessing Atmospheric Nitrogen Deposition to Natural and Semi-natural Ecosystems - Experience From Danish Studies Using the DAMOS	Local agricultural emissions contribute significantly to the atmospheric reactive nitrogen loads of Danish terrestrial ecosystems. In the vicinity of the sources this may be up to 6e8 kgNha1 yr1 depending on location and ecosystem type. This contribution arises from dry deposition of gas phase ammonia derived from local livestock production. Long-range transport, however, often constitutes the largest contribution to the overall atmospheric terrestrial reactive nitrogen loadings in Denmark. This is often in the range 10 - 15 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and consists mainly of aerosol phase nitrate and ammonium (reaction products of nitrogen oxides and ammonia), but also dry deposition of other reactive nitrogen compounds (mainly nitrogen oxides in the form of gas phase nitric acid and nitrogen dioxide). In Denmark’s environmental  management of the sensitive terrestrial ecosystems modelling tools are required that account for both the local and the long-range transported contributions. This motivated development of the Danish Ammonia MOdelling System (DAMOS) that has been successfully applied to the assessment of atmospheric nitrogen loadings to sensitive Danish ecosystems. We present here three different examples of such assessments. Our results show that ecosystems located in Western Denmark (Case 1) receive the highest loads of atmospheric nitrogen depositions which generally exceed the critical load. This part of the country has the highest livestock density. In the Eastern part of the country, the atmospheric loadings are often below or close to the lower end of the interval for critical load values. These lower loads in Eastern Denmark (Case 2) are due to lower density of agricultural activities, as well as, lower precipitation rates, which leads to less wet deposition of reactive nitrogen. In general there is a gradient in  atmospheric deposition over the country, with the highest depositions in the South-Western part of Denmark (Case 3) due to long-range transport contributions from North-Western Europe, but also due to local ammonia deposition associated with the high local emission from the high density livestock farming in this area.	ecosystems,terrestrial ecosystems
The effect of climate and climate change on ammonia emissions in Europe	We present here a dynamical method for modelling temporal and geographical variations in ammonia emissions in regional-scale chemistry transport models (CTMs) and chemistry climate models (CCMs). The method is based on the meteorology in the models and gridded inventories. We use the dynamical method to investigate the spatiotemporal variability of ammonia emissions across part of Europe and study how these emissions are related to geographical and year-to-year variations in atmospheric temperature alone. For simplicity we focus on the emission from a storage facility related to a standard Danish pig stable with 1000 animals and display how emissions from this source would vary geographically throughout central and northern Europe and from year to year. In view of future climate changes, we also evaluate the potential future changes in emission by including temperature projections from an ensemble of climate models. The results point towards four overall issues. (1) Emissions can easily vary by 20% for different geographical locations within a country due to overall variations in climate. The largest uncertainties are seen for large countries such as the UK, Germany and France. (2)Annual variations in overall climate can at specific locations cause uncertainties in the range of 20 %. (3) Climate change may increase emissions by 0–40% in central to northern Europe.(4) Gradients in existing emission inventories that are seen between neighbour countries (e.g. between the UK and France) can be reduced by using a dynamical methodology for calculating emissions. Acting together these four factors can cause substantial uncertainties in emission. Emissions are generally considered among the largest uncertainties in the model calculations made with CTM and CCM models. Efforts to reduce uncertainties are therefore highly relevant.It is therefore recommended that both CCMs and CTMs implement a dynamical methodology for simulating ammonia emissions in a similar way as for biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOCs) – a method that has been used for more than a decade in CTMs. Finally, the climate penalty on ammonia emissions should be taken into account at the policy level such as the NEC and IPPC directives.	climate change
A Multinational Health Professional Perspective of the Prevalence of Mood Disorders in Patients with Acute and Chronic Wounds.	Recent research has started to identify mood disorders and problems associated with acute and chronic wounds, which have been shown to contribute to delayed healing, poor patient well-being and a reduced quality of life. Furthermore, mood disorders have been shown to have a negative impact on financial costs for service providers and the wider society in terms of treatment and sickness absence. This study aimed to survey a multinational sample of health professionals to explore their perspective and awareness of mood disorders amongst acute and chronic wound patients. Responses were received from n = 908 health professionals working in Asia, Africa, Australia, Europe, North America and South America. A strong awareness of the prevalence of mood disorders appeared to be widespread among the health professionals across the world, in addition to a view on the potential factors contributing to these problems with mood. Despite this, it was thought that few patients were actually receiving treatment for their mood disorders. Implications for clinical practice include the need for health professionals to actively engage with their patients to enable them to learn from their experiences. Studies that explore the benefits of treatments and techniques appropriate for minimising mood disorders in patients with wounds would provide empirical evidence for health professionals to make recommendations for patients with acute and chronic wounds.	well-being
The Meaning and Experience of Work in the Context of Severe and Enduring Mental Health Problems: an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis.	Research into mental health and employment has indicated that work holds multiple meanings for people with mental health problems. This paper reports findings from a phenomenological study which aimed to understand the complexity of these meanings by exploration of the perspectives of one individual who was considering returning to work. Data were gathered through a series of three interviews carried out over a period of 18 months.  Three themes were identified – Beliefs and Values about Work, Working with a Mental Health Problem, and Planning for the Future. Analysis and interpretation facilitated understandings of what work represented for the participant. What this study has contributed to the evidence base is a deeper understanding of the multiple meanings of work, and the varied roles that work may play in contributing to meaning and quality of life for people with mental health problems.	employment
Changes in the Air Cell Volume of Artificially Incubated Ostrich Eggs.	A total of 2160 images of candled, incubated ostrich eggs were digitized to determine the percentage of egg volume occupied by the air cell at different stages of incubation. The air cell on average occupied 2.5% of the volume of fresh eggs. For eggs that hatched successfully, this volume increased to an average of 24.4% at 41 days of incubation, just prior to hatching. Air cell volume at 29 days of incubation for infertile eggs (19.3%) was significantly higher when compared to dead-in-shell (DIS) eggs (14.3%) and eggs that hatched (13.8%). There was a significantly larger air cell volume in eggs that hatched normally compared with DIS eggs at 41 days of incubation (28.3% vs. 21.7%, respectively). No differences in air cell volume were observed up to day 17 of incubation for eggs that hatched normally between eggs that exhibited high, average or low rates of water loss, but from 20 days of incubation the air cell volume was significantly larger for high weight loss eggs. However, for the DIS eggs, air cell volume was consistently larger in eggs that exhibited high rates of water loss. Air cell volume was largely independent of adult strain (SA Black or Zimbabwean Blue) or whether chicks were assisted to hatch. Although some subtle differences in air cell size were detected between hatched and DIS chicks during this study, it is unlikely to find useful application in the broader industry.	water
Policy Persistence and Cultural Resistance: The (Re-) Development of Horticulture in the Vale of Evesham	Rural geographers have frequently discussed the development of rural areas in  terms of paradigms. Focusing on the Vale of Evesham in the south Midlands of  England, UK, this paper instead uses the three cross-cutting themes of  historicity, conflict and neo-industrialisation to illuminate the development  trajectory of this locality based upon its strong horticultural tradition. The   emergence, growth and decline of a culturally, socially and economically unique  horticultural sector in the Vale is described against a backdrop of policy  persistence favouring other farming enterprises. The way in which historicities  of small-scale market gardening are being created, appropriated and reified for  local and tourist consumption, is discussed through analysis of four recent  horticultural-related inventions. These serve to deny the ‘real’ change occurring  in the Vale’s horticultural sector driven by neo-industrialisation, although a lack  of conflict is found to be associated with such change. The paper concludes by  outlining the prospects for future tensions over the (re)development of  horticulture in the Vale.	consumption
Major Flood Disturbance Alters River Ecosystem Evolution	Floods, major formative drivers of channel and floodplain structure and associated riparian and in-stream communities are increasing in intensity and magnitude with climate change in many regions of the world. However, predicting how floods will affect stream channels and their communities as climate changes is limited by a lack of long-term pre-flood baseline data sets across different organismal groups. Here we show salmon, macroinvertebrate and meiofauna communities, monitored for 30 years in a system evolving owing to glacier retreat, were modified significantly by a major rainfall event that caused substantial geomorphic change to the stream channel. Pink salmon, reduced to one-tenth of pre-flood spawner densities, recovered within two generations. Macroinvertebrate community structure was significantly different after the flood as some pioneer taxa, which had become locally extinct, recolonized whereas some later colonizers were eliminated. The trajectory of the macroinvertebrate succession was reset towards the community structure of 15 years earlier. Meiofaunal abundance recovered rapidly and richness increased post-flood with some previously unrecorded taxa colonizing. Biotic recovery was independent of geomorphological recovery. Markedly different responses according to the organismal group suggest caution is required when applying general aquatic ecosystem theories and concepts to predict flood events.	climate change
Pollen Season and Climate: Is the Timing of Birch Pollen Release in the UK Approaching its Limit?	In light of heightened interest in the response of pollen phenology to temperature, we investigated recent changes to the onset of Betula (birch) pollen seasons in central and southern England, including a test of predicted advancement of the Betula pollen season for London. We calculated onset of birch pollen seasons using daily airborne pollen data obtained at London, Plymouth and Worcester, determined trends in the start of the pollen season and compared timing of the birch pollen season with observed temperature patterns for the period 1995–2010. We found no overall change in the onset of birch pollen in the study period although there was evidence that the response to temperature was nonlinear and that a lower asymptotic start of the pollen season may exist. The start of the birch pollen season was strongly correlated with March mean temperature. These results reinforce previous findings showing that the timing of the birch pollen season in the UK is particularly sensitive to spring temperatures. The climate relationship shown here persists over both longer decadal-scale trends and shorter, seasonal trends as well as during periods of ‘sign-switching’ when cooler spring temperatures result in later start dates. These attributes, combined with the wide geographical coverage of airborne pollen monitoring sites, some with records extending back several decades, provide a powerful tool for the detection of climate change impacts, although local site factors and the requirement for winter chilling may be confounding factors.	climate change
Moving Beyond Heterosexism? Interrogating Others’ Reactions to Important Life Events (Conference abstract)	Introduction: In recent years the psychology of sexualities has diversified. There has been increased engagement with queer theory and a heightened focus on sexual practices, alongside continued interrogation of heteronormativity via analyses of talk-in-interaction.   Aims: I offer an argument for juxtaposing the incongruent in order to further interrogate manifestations of heterosexism in lesbian, gay, bisexual, trans and queer (LGBTQ) people’s lives. In this case, accounts of others’ reactions to a happy event and to a sad experience.   Methods: I draw on two contrasting data corpuses – 124 people planning or in a civil partnership and 60 women who had experienced pregnancy loss. These data were collected from LGBT participants in the UK, the USA, Canada and Australia (2005-2009) via interviews and questionnaires.   Results: I explore the ways that the issues of muted reactions and displays of heteronormativity are manifest in these data. In considering these issues with respect to accounts of these two very different forms of experience (civil partnership and pregnancy loss) I demonstrate how both a sense of being treated differently is produced as problematic.  But also, in the case of pregnancy loss, being treated the same (as the implied heterosexual norm) is similarly produced as troublesome. I argue that it is in the nuances of the presentation of o/Other’s reactions that we can see the continued operation of heteronormativity.  Conclusions: I suggest that, despite significant legal and structural gains for LGBTQ communities in a number of Western countries in recent years, and lively internal debates within the psychology of sexualities field, critical examination of manifestations of heterosexism should remain a central focus. I also argue that there is increased potential for understanding variation in ‘normative’ and/or heteronormative interpretations of LGBTQ lives when data-sets on disparate topics are interrogated.	women
Penalty Corner Routines in Elite Women’s Indoor Field Hockey: Prediction of Outcomes based on Tactical Decisions	Indoor hockey is a highly competitive international sport, yet no research to date has investigated the key actions within this sport.  As with outdoor field hockey, penalty corners represent one of the most likely situations in which goals can be scored.  All 36 matches of the round-robin phase of the 2010-2011 England Hockey League Women’s Premier Division ‘Super Sixes’ competition were analysed with the purpose of establishing which factors can predict the scoring of a goal using Binary Logistic Regression analysis.  Seventy two (22.6%) of the 319 observed penalty corners resulted in a goal. The strongest predictor of scoring a goal was taking the penalty corner from the goalkeeper’s right.  Based on the odds ratio (OR), the odds of the attacking team scoring were 2.27 (CI = 1.41 - 3.65) times higher with penalty corners taken from the goalkeeper’s right as opposed to the left. Additionally, if the goalkeeper decided to rush to the edge of the circle, the odds of the attacking team failing to score were 2.19 (CI = 1.18 - 4.08) times higher compared to when the goalkeeper remained near the goal line. These results suggest that strategic decisions from the players and coaches have an important part to play in the success of penalty corners.  Future research should investigate the impact of goalkeepers’ movement and further examine the technical and tactical intricacies of penalty corners.	women
Structuring the Unstructured: Service Innovation in a UK Small Business Services Firm	This study focuses on structured innovation models for the services sector. A plethora of research recognizes the importance of formal and structured innovation processes (Booz et al., 1982; Bowers, 1989; Scheuing and Johnson, 1989; Griffin, 1997; Johne and Storey, 1998; Cooper and Edgett, 1999; Cooper, 1986, 2001; Akamavi, 2005).   The literature however lacks process models that specifically address services development. Cooper and Edgett (1999) with their ‘stage-gate’ model attempt to provide such an approach. This generic ‘from idea to launch’ innovation system was generated through research in leading USA business to consumer (B2C) companies. The innovation system, whilst constructed on the basis of best practice, was not designed to meet the needs of business to business (B2B) services firms.   Alongside the lack of process models, a number of researchers claim that service firms have no process, or use unstructured, informal and often ‘ad hoc’ service development processes (Sundbo, 1997; Gottfridsson, 2011). It is therefore unclear whether a systematic approach to service innovation, or indeed the implementation of a model such as the ‘stage-gate’ (Cooper and Edgett, 1999) is useful for B2B services firms.     This study therefore reports on a case study of a small B2B services firm implementing a novel ‘end-to-end’ innovation system, and considers the implications for its management practices. In this longitudinal case study (18 months), we adopted a participant observational methodology (Jorgensen, 1989), with connotations of action science (Argyris and Schön, 1978). The research involved all those participating in the innovation system in the firm, including decision-makers, middle managers and employees at lower hierarchical levels and the firm’s external networks.    The researchers established that a systematic approach to service innovation through structured process could meet the needs of the case study organization and it is found that such a process is appropriate and useful in the context of small B2B services firm. The paper explains the reasons why such an approach was found to be appropriate and useful, in the context of small B2B services firm.   A better understanding is provided of how small business services firm can adapt and improve the usefulness of such a structured process.       Key words: innovation, services, new service development, B2B, small business	innovation
