Ponding in Intermittent Streams: a Refuge for Lotic Taxa and a Habitat for Newly Colonising Taxa?	Intermittent rivers are temporally dynamic, shifting between lotic, lentic (ponding) and dry habitat phases, yet almost all research effort has focussed on the lotic phase, with limited research attention on the lentic and dry phases. Information regarding the biological diversity of the lentic phase is vital to quantify the total aquatic biodiversity, their use as flow refugia, and the long-term conservation and management of intermittent rivers. In this study, we compared the diversity and composition of macroinvertebrates from perennial, intermittent and ponded sites in two intermittent rivers in the United Kingdom. We examined whether instream ponding provided refugia for lotic taxa and a habitat for newly colonising taxa. A total of 129 taxa (perennial - 86, intermittent - 82, ponding - 78) were recorded. Instream ponds were found to support heterogeneous communities compared to flowing sites. Twenty-two percent of taxa were recorded only from ponded sites, many of which were lentic specialists, while 38% of taxa persisted in instream ponds after flow had ceased. Results from this study highlight that instream ponds provide an important flow refuge for macroinvertebrates including rheophilic taxa, which move into instream ponds when channels become longitudinally disconnected, and makes a significant contribution to aquatic diversity in intermittent rivers, providing suitable habitat for newly colonising taxa. Aquatic diversity in intermittent rivers may have been underestimated historically, failing to acknowledge the ecological contribution of the lentic phase. Incorporating the ponding phase alongside the lotic phase will ensure the total aquatic biodiversity of intermittent rivers is quantified and effective biodiversity conservation and management strategies are employed.
Trait Emotional Intelligence and Attentional Bias for Positive Emotion: an Eye Tracking Study	Emotional intelligence (EI) may promote wellbeing through facilitation of adaptive attentional processing patterns. In the current study, a total of 54 adults (43 females, mean age = 25 years, SD = 10 years) completed a Trait Emotional Intelligence (TEI) scale and took part in three eye-tracking tasks, where they viewed (1) faces with different emotions (happy, angry, fearful, neutral), (2) 16-face crowds with varying ratios of happy to angry faces, and (3) 4 visual scenes (physical threat, social threat, positive social, neutral). Findings showed that higher TEI was associated with more attention to positive emotional stimuli (happy faces, positive social scenes), relative to negative and neutral stimuli.  An attentional preference for positive rather than negative emotional stimuli may be one way that TEI affords protection from stressors to promote mental health.
A Randomized Controlled Trial of Comprehensive Early Intervention Care in Patients with First-Episode Psychosis in Japan: 1.5-year Outcomes from the J-CAP Study	The first episode of psychosis represents a critical period wherein comprehensive early intervention in psychosis (EIP) may alter the course of illness. However, evidence from randomized controlled trials that have examined the impact of comprehensive EIP care on clinical and functional recovery assessed by independent blinded raters is limited. The objective of this study was to conduct a single-blinded multicenter trial comparing comprehensive EIP care and standard care in young patients with first-episode psychosis (FEP) in Japan (J-CAP Study). A total of 77 participants with FEP (aged 15–35 years) were randomized to receive standard care or specialized comprehensive EIP care and were followed up for 1.5 years (trial no.: UMIN000005092). Function (measured with the Global Assessment of Functioning) and clinical remission (defined by internationally standardized criteria proposed by the Remission in Schizophrenia Working Group) were evaluated by independent raters who were blinded to group assignment. Dropout rate and other secondary outcomes were also examined. The specialized EIP care group had a higher clinical remission rate (odds ratio, 6.3; 95% confidence interval, 1.0–37.9) and lower treatment dropout rate (odds ratio, 0.038; 95% confidence interval, 0.002–0.923) than the standard care group, even after adjusting for baseline characteristics. Functional improvement in the specialized EIP care group was slightly higher than that in the standard care group, but this difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.195). From the results, we conclude that comprehensive EIP care may provide advantages over standard care in patients with FEP.
Widening Higher Education Participation in Rural Communities in England: An Anchor Institution Model	Against a United Kingdom policy background of attempts to widen higher education participation in a socially inclusive direction, this article analyses theory, policy and practice to understand why past efforts have had limited success and to propose an alternative: an "anchor institution" model. A university and a private training provider were the principal partners in this venture, known as the South-West Partnership; the model was developed by them to meet the particular needs of mature female students who want and/or need to study part-time in a rural, coastal and isolated area of south-west England. While the concept of "anchor institutions" has previously been used in government social policy, and in higher education to promote knowledge transfer, it has not yet been adopted as a method for widening participation. The research study presented in this article investigated the effectiveness of the model in widening higher education participation in the context of the South-West Partnership. The study was conducted within an interpretivist theoretical framework. It accessed student voice to illustrate the character of education required to widen participation in vocational higher education by mature female students in rural communities, through semi-structured qualitative interviews on a range of topics identified from relevant theoretical literature, and by drawing on the research team's professional knowledge and experience. These topics included student aspirations and career destinations, motivations, access, learning experiences, and peer and tutor support. It is hoped the findings will inform the future development of adult vocational higher education provision in rural areas, where opportunities have been limited, and encourage further application of the anchor institution model for widening participation elsewhere.
From Manned to Unmanned Aircraft: Adapting Airborne  Particle Size Mapping Methodologies to the Characteristics  of sUAS and SfM	Subaerial particle size data holds a wealth of valuable information for fluvial, coastal, glacial and other sedimentological applications. Recently, we have gained the opportunity to map and quantify particle sizes at the mesoscale using data derived from small unmanned aerial system (sUAS) imagery processed using structure from motion (SfM) photogrammetry. These sUAS-SfM approaches have been based typically on calibrating orthoimage texture or point cloud roughness with particle size. Variable levels of success are reported and a single, robust method capable of producing consistently accurate and precise results in a range of settings has remained elusive. In this paper, we develop an original method for particle size mapping with the specific constraints of sUAS and SfM in mind. This method uses the texture of single sUAS images, rather than orthoimages, calibrated with particle sizes normalised by individual image scale. We compare results against existing orthoimage texture and roughness approaches, and provide the first quantitative investigation into the implications of the use of sUAS camera gimbals. Our results indicate that our novel single image method delivers the optimal particle size mapping performance for our study site, outperforming both other methods and delivering residual mean errors of 0.02mm (accuracy), standard deviation of residual errors of 6.90mm (precision) and maximum residual errors of 16.50mm. Accuracy values are more than two orders of magnitude worse when a camera gimbal is not used, thereby demonstrating the critical importance of mechanical image stabilisation for particle size mapping using measures of image texture.
Wildflower Strip Establishment for the Delivery of Ecosystem Services in Sweet Cherry Orchards	The practice of introducing wildflower habitats in cropped areas is an approach that can be used to enhance ecosystem services. The value of such an approach will be affected by the establishment success of the sown species. To investigate this, 12 strips of wildflower habitat were established in alleyways between rows of cherry trees at three sites in the West Midlands (UK). The establishment of plants in sown strips was compared to six untreated alleyways that received conventional management. Eight forb species and one grass species was sown in strips measuring 1 m × 95 m. The establishment success of the sown species and their contribution to the vegetation of the alleyway was determined using percentage cover assessments in replicate quadrats. Dactylis glomerata, Leucanthemum vulgare, Prunella vulgaris and Lotus corniculatus established most consistently and with greater cover values in the sown strips. However, the sown strips were also associated with a greater abundance of unsown species, some of which are classed as weeds.
The Influence of Seed Mix and Management on the Performance and Persistence of Sown Forbs in Buffer Strips	A popular option under agri-environmental schemes throughout Europe has been the introduction of buffer strips adjacent to field boundaries. Buffer strips are usually established using grass-only seed mixes, or through natural regeneration. As a consequence, their  function and biodiversity value might be limited due to a low presence of desirable forb species. Given the financial barrier of using forb-rich seed mixes, there is a need to identify species that establish reliably in parallel with management options that encourage their  persistence. In a 5-year study across three different sites we investigated the responses of 32 different  forb species sown in two different grass-based seed mixes tailored to soil type. Generally, there was an increase in sown forb cover with time, and this effect was greatest in plots sown with fine-grasses treated with an application of graminicide or an annual cut. We  have identified a suite of ten forb species that are likely to establish and persist in buffer strip habitats.
Detection and Seroprevalence of Morbillivirus and Other Paramyxoviruses in Geriatric Cats with and without Evidence of Azotemic Chronic Kidney Disease	Feline morbillivirus (FeMV) is associated with the presence of tubulo-interstitial nephritis (TIN) in cats, however the seroprevalence of FeMV in the UK and the association between the presence of FeMV and renal azotemia is unknown HYPOTHESIS/OBJECTIVES: To identify whether paramyxoviruses are present in urine samples of geriatric cats and to develop an assay to assess FeMV seroprevalence. To investigate the relationship between both urinary paramyxovirus (including FeMV) excretion and FeMV seroprevalence and azotemic chronic kidney disease (CKD). Seventy-nine cats (40 for FeMV detection; 72 for seroprevalence). Retrospective cross-sectional, case control study. Viral RNA was extracted from urine for RT-PCR. PCR products were sequenced for virus identification and comparison. The FeMV N protein gene was cloned and partially purified for use as an antigen to screen cat sera for anti-FeMV antibodies by Western Blot. Feline morbillivirus RNA from five distinct morbilliviruses were identified. Detection was not significantly different between azotemic CKD (1/16) and nonazotemic groups (4/24; P = .36). Three distinct, non-FeMV paramyxoviruses were present in the nonazotemic group but their absence from the azotemic group was not statistically significant (P = .15). 6/14 (43%) azotemic cats and 40/55 (73%) nonazotemic cats were seropositive (P = .06). Feline morbillivirus was detected in cats in the UK for the First time. However, there was no association between virus prevalence or seropositivity and azotemic CKD. These data do not support the hypothesis that FeMV infection is associated with the development of azotemic CKD in cats in the UK. [Abstract copyright: © 2018 The Authors.

How to Inspire Vocational Learners and Raise Aspirations	Inspiring learners and raising aspirations lies at the heart of vocational education and training, and is central to the professional practice of teachers,work-based mentors and assessors.Raising aspirations is a complex challenge for the further education and training sector due to the range and diversity of provision and changes imposed by successive governments.In this changing policy and educational context, it is the professional practice  of all those who work in the sector that enables vocational learners to achieve their ambitions.This article aims to contribute to existing professional practice by using  evidence from educational research and theories of teaching, learning and assessment to suggest practical  strategies for inspiring and motivating learners on vocational programmes.The strategies and examples of  what works come from vocational and lifelong provision in colleges,independent training providers,workplaces and community settings.The content of this article links  to standard 3 in the Professional Standards for Teachers and Trainers in Education and Training framework  (inspire, motivate and raise aspirations of learners through your enthusiasm and knowledge) and to standard  13 (motivate and inspire learners to promote achievement and develop their skills to enable progression).
Changing It Up: Implications of Mid-season Coach Change on Basketball Players’ Career and Professional Identities	Career and professional identities are utilized as a conceptual framework to consider the complexities of basketball players’ working lives amidst mid-season coach change. Seven male professional basketball players, working in top European leagues, participated in semi-structured interviews. The interviews were centred on career trajectories and incidents of mid-season coach change. Results indicate sports workers’ career success is contingent upon strategically undertaking identity work in order to best respond to the demands of the organizational context. Players’ experiences of coach turnover, for example, may have varied however, the event had discernible influence on how they understood themselves, their positional relationship and overall longevity in the sport. Of concern is the necessity for organizations to appreciate their roles in shaping the settings in which their employees work, and the related consequences that contextual changes have in worker’s abilities to labour and the strategies they may need to utilize to cope with such change.
Sight, Sound and Text in the History of Education	This special issue arose from a joint conference of the History of Education Society, UK and the Australian and New Zealand History of Education Society, held in Malvern in Worcestershire, England in 2016 on the theme ‘sight, sound and text in the history of education’. The conference drew together media and educational historians, as well as archivists and museum professionals, to examine both methodological issues and a range of examples of sensory and textual histories. The three-day event, as well as being enriching for its international character, proved that although much work has already been done in this area, there is so much more to consider and exploit when it comes to the study of the ‘new’ sonic and visual sources and their intertextual relationship with the documentary, as well as traditional understandings of ‘text’.
Structural and Predictive Properties of the Emotional Quotient Inventory Youth Version - Short Form (EQ-i:YV[s])	Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a popular construct with concentrated areas of application in education and health contexts. There is a need for reliable and valid measurement of EI in young people, with brief yet sensitive measures of the construct preferable for use in time-limited settings.  However, the proliferation of EI measures has often outpaced rigorous psychometric evaluation (Gignac, 2009). Using data from 849 adolescents (407 females; 422 males) aged 11 to 16 years (mean age 13.4; SD = 1.2 years), the current paper systematically examined the structural and predictive properties of a frequently employed measure of adolescent trait EI – the Emotional Quotient Inventory Youth Version Short Form - EQ-i:YV(S) (Bar-On & Parker, 2000). Whilst the intended multidimensional factor structure was recovered through confirmatory factor analysis, the statistical and conceptual coherency of the underlying model was inadequate.  Using a multi-trait multi-method approach, the EQ-i:YV(S) was found to converge with other measures of EI, however, evidence for divergent validity (Big Five personality dimensions) was less robust.  Predictive utility for adolescent mental health outcomes (depression; disruptive behavior) was also limited. Findings suggest that use of the EQ-i:YV(S) for predictive or evaluative purposes should be avoided until refinements to the scale are made.
A Suppressor/Avirulence Gene Combination in Hyaloperonospora Arabidopsidis Determines Race Specificity in Arabidopsis Thaliana	The pathosystem of Arabidopsis thaliana and diploid biotrophic oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) has been a model for investigating the molecular basis of Flor’s gene-for-gene hypothesis. The isolates Hpa-Noks1 and Hpa-Cala2 are virulent on Arabidopsis accession RMX-A02 whilst an F1 generated from a cross between these two isolates was avirulent. The F2 progeny segregated  3,1 (avirulent, virulent), indicating a single major effect AVR locus in this pathogen. SNP-based linkage mapping confirmed a single AVR locus within a 14 kb map interval containing two genes encoding putative effectors. The Hpa-Cala2 allele of one gene, designated H. arabidopsidis cryptic1 (HAC1), encodes a protein with a signal peptide and an RxLR/dEER motif, and triggers a defense response in RMX-A02. The second gene is heterozygous in Hpa-Cala2. One allele, designated Suppressor of HAC1Cala2 (S-HAC1Cala2) encodes a protein with a signal peptide and a dKEE motif with no RxLR  motif; the other allele (s-hac1 Cala2) encodes a protein with a signal peptide, a dEEE motif and is divergent in sequence from the S-HAC1Cala2 allele. In selfed progeny from Hpa-Cala2, dominant S-HAC1Cala2 allele carrying progeny correlates with virulence in RMX-A02, whereas homozygous recessive s-hac1Cala2 carrying progeny were avirulent. Genetic investigations suggested other heterozygous suppressor loci might exist in the  Hpa-Cala2 genome.
Can the British Heart Foundation PocketCPR Application Improve the Performance of Chest Compressions During Bystander Resuscitation: a Randomised Crossover Manikin  Study	This study aims to determine whether the British Heart Foundation (BHF) PocketCPR application can improve the depth and rate of chest compression, and therefore be confidently recommended for bystander use.  118 candidates were recruited into a randomised crossover manikin trial. Each candidate performed CPR for two-minutes without instruction, or performed chest compressions using the PocketCPR application. Candidates then performed a further two minutes of CPR within the opposite arm.  The number of chest compressions performed improved when PocketCPR was used compared to chest compressions when it was not (44.28% v40.57, P<0.001). The number of chest compressions performed to the required depth was higher in the PocketCPR group (90.86 v 66.26).  The BHF PocketCPR application improved the percentage of chest compressions that were performed to the required depth. Despite this, more work is required in order to develop a feedback device that can improve bystander CPR without creating delay.
LTHEchat – The Story of a Community of Practice through Twitter	The original idea for an ongoing tweetchat for professional development came from Dr. Chrissi Nerantzi. The idea emerged through the success of the #BYOD4Lchat, a daily feature of the 5-day openly-licensed course Bring Your Own Devices for Learning (BYOD4L), first offered in January 2014 and based on flexible, distance and online learning (FDOL) Offered Monday to Friday from 8-9pm UK time #BYOD4Lchat always created a real buzz. Chrissi saw the potential for a tweetchat on its own, outside a course that would have the potential to develop a community around it. Courses have such a short lifespan, she thought. What about a community approach to professional development? If we want our academics engaged in ongoing professional development could a weekly tweetchat be an attractive option? Could it work? She wanted to give it a go! When the idea matured a little bit in her head, she shared it with Sue Beckingham over a Skype meeting and then with Dr. David Walker and Peter Reed in an email signing as Chrissi and Sue. She wanted the tweetchat to become a truly collaborative project from the outset and therefore creating the conditions for co-ownership were important to her. The Learning and Teaching in Higher Education tweetchat, or #LTHEchat, came to live. The name came from a core module Chrissi led while working at the University of Salford. Chrissi, Sue, David and Peter became the steering group and decided to run a 3-month pilot and see how it went.
Multitrait Analysis of Fresh-Cut Cantaloupe Melon Enables Discrimination Between Storage Times and Temperatures and Identifies Potential Markers for Quality Assessments	Fresh-cut cantaloupe melon is valued for its aroma but is highly perishable. Temperature of storage (typically 0-5°C) is critical for maintaining fresh-cut melon quality, but often reaches 10 Â°C during transportation and in retail outlets. A comparison amongst 0, 5 and 10 Â°C storage temperatures for fresh-cut melon over 14 days reveals that storage at 0 Â°C is optimal for avoiding increases in microbial load and loss of vitamin C especially at later time points. However, higher temperatures maintain better the balance of esters (acetate versus non-acetate) and phenolic content. The whole volatile organic compound (VOC) profile can be used to discriminate both time and temperature effects especially at earlier time points. Potential VOC markers for changes in vitamin C from day 0 to day 6 of storage (3-methyl butane nitrile) and temperature (limonene) are identified through a multi-trait analysis.
The Impact of Childhood Sexual Abuse on the Outcome of Intensive Trauma-focused Treatment for PTSD	It is assumed that PTSD patients with a history of childhood sexual abuse benefit less from trauma-focused treatment than those without such a history. : To test whether the presence of a history of childhood sexual abuse has a negative effect on the outcome of intensive trauma-focused PTSD treatment. : PTSD patients, 83% of whom suffered from severe PTSD, took part in a therapy programme consisting of 2 × 4 consecutive days of Prolonged Exposure (PE) and EMDR therapy (eight of each). In between sessions, patients participated in sport activities and psycho-education sessions. No prior stabilization phase was implemented. PTSD symptom scores of clinician-administered and self-administered measures were analysed using the data of 165 consecutive patients. Pre-post differences were compared between four trauma groups; patients with a history of childhood sexual abuse before age 12 (CSA), adolescent sexual abuse (ASA; i.e. sexual abuse between 12 and 18 years of age), sexual abuse (SA) at age 18 and over, or no history of sexual abuse (NSA). : Large effect sizes were achieved for PTSD symptom reduction for all trauma groups (Cohen's  = 1.52-2.09). For the Clinical Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Impact of Event Scale (IES), no differences in treatment outcome were found between the trauma (age) groups. For the PTSD Symptom Scale Self Report (PSS-SR), there were no differences except for one small effect between CSA and NSA. : The results do not support the hypothesis that the presence of a history of childhood sexual abuse has a detrimental impact on the outcome of first-line (intensive) trauma-focused treatments for PTSD.
Involved, Inputting or Informing?: ‘Shared’ Decision Making in Adult Mental Healthcare	Background  A diagnosis of serious mental illness can impact on the whole family.  Families informally provide significant amounts of care but are disproportionately at risk of carer burden when compared to those supporting people with other long-term conditions.  Shared decision making (SDM) is an ethical model of health communication associated with positive health outcomes, however there has been little research to evaluate how routinely family are invited to participate in SDM, or what this looks like in practice.   Objective  This UK study aimed to better understand how the family caregivers of those diagnosed with SMI are currently involved in decision making, particularly decisions about treatment options including prescribed medication.  Objectives were to:-  • Explore the extent to which family members wish to be involved in decisions about prescribed medication  • Determine how and when professionals engage family in these decisions   • Identify barriers and facilitators associated with the engagement of family in decisions about treatment.     Participants  Open-ended questions were sent to professionals and family members to elicit written responses.  Qualitative responses were analysed thematically.   Results  Themes included the definition of involvement and ‘rules of engagement’.  Staff members are gatekeepers for family involvement and the process is not democratic.  Family and staff ascribe practical, rather than recovery-oriented roles to family, with preoccupation around notions of adherence.    Conclusions  Staff members need support, training and education to apply SDM.  Time to exchange information is vital but practically difficult.  Negotiated teams, comprising of staff, service users, family, peers as applicable, with ascribed roles and responsibilities could support SDM.
Comparative WGBS Identifies Genes that Influence Non-ripe Phenotype in Tomato Epimutant Colourless Non-ripening	Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) allows single-base resolution and genome-wide profiling of DNA methylation in plants and animals. This technology provides a powerful tool to identify genes that are potentially controlled by dynamic changes of DNA methylation and demethylation. However, naturally occurring epimutants are rare and genes under epigenetic regulation as well as their biological relevances are often difficult to define. In tomato, fruit development and ripening are a complex process that involves epigenetic control. We have taken the advantage of the tomato epimutant Colourless non-ripening (Cnr) and performed comparative mining of the WGBS datasets for the Cnr and SlCMT3-silenced Cnr fruits. We compared DNA methylation profiles for the promoter sequences of approximately 5,000 bp immediately upstream of the coding region of a list of 20 genes. Differentially methylated regions were found for some of these genes. Virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of differentially methylated gene SlDET1 or SlPDS resulted in unusual brown pigmentation in Cnr fruits. These results suggest that comparative WGBS coupled with VIGS can be used to identify genes that may contribute to the colourless unripe phenotype of fruit in the Cnr epimutant.

A Genetic Network for Systemic RNA Silencing in Plants	Non-cell autonomous RNA silencing can spread from cell to cell and over long-distance in animals and plants. However, the genetic requirements and signals involved in plant mobile silencing remain poorly understood. Here, we identified a DICER-LIKE2 (DCL2)-dependent mechanism for systemic spread of post-transcriptional RNA silencing (also known as post-transcriptional gene silencing, PTGS) in Nicotiana benthamiana. Using a suite of transgenic DCL RNAi lines coupled with a GFP reporter, we demonstrated that N. benthamiana DCL1, DCL2, DCL3 or DCL4 is required to produce microRNAs, 22, 24 or 21nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), respectively. All sized siRNAs produced in local incipient cells were present at low levels in distal tissues. Inhibition of DCL2 expression reduced the long-distance spread of silencing, as opposed to suppression of DCL3 or DCL4 which enhanced systemic PTGS. DCL2-DCL4 double-RNAi developed systemic PTGS like DCL2 RNAi lines, but in contrast to DCL4 RNAi lines. We further show that 21 or 24nt local siRNAs processed by DCL4 or DCL3 were not correlated with long-distance spread of systemic silencing. Grafting experiments demonstrated that DCL2 was required in the scion to respond to the signal, but not in the rootstock to produce/send the signal. These results suggest a coordinated DCL genetic pathway in which DCL2 plays an essential role in systemic PTGS, whilst both DCL4 and DCL3 may act as attenuators of systemic PTGS in N. benthamiana. The potential role of 21, 22 and 24nt siRNAs in long-distance spread of PTGS is discussed.
Towards the End of Life: an In-depth Exploration of the Role of Admiral Nursing in Dementia Care (Innovative Practice)	There are approximately 150 Admiral Nurses in the UK who work alongside other health and social care professionals to support people with dementia and their family carers. However, the stigma of the disease and the lack of recognition that dementia is a life limiting illness have led to neglect in addressing the end of life challenges. The small in-depth study reported here aimed to add to an extremely limited formal evidence base for the effectiveness of this approach and to develop a greater understanding of the range of knowledge and skills required of them in ensuring they are better able to support families in the later stages of the illness. Findings focus on the experiences of family carers, the impact of performing the Admiral Nurse role and the use of qualitative measures in this setting.
Cross-sensitization to Artemisia and Ambrosia Pollen Allergens in an Area Located Outside of the Current Distribution Range of Ambrosia	Introduction : The role of long-distance transported (LDT) Ambrosia pollen in inducing new sensitization and affecting sensitization rates in Artemisia -sensitized patients is unclear. Aim : The aim of this study was to estimate the degree of cross-sensitization to Ambrosia / Artemisia allergens in citizens of Poznan (Western Poland). This area is covered by extensive Artemisia populations but does not currently have local Ambrosia populations. Material and methods : Sera of 119 patients were tested by fluoroenzyme immunoassay (CAP-FEIA system) against pollen allergen extracts of Artemisia vulgaris and Ambrosia artemisiifolia , an allergenic component of A. vulgaris (nArt v 1), and an allergenic component of A. artemisiifolia ( nAmb a 1 ). Skin prick tests (SPTs, n = 86) were performed with pollen allergen extracts of A. vulgaris and A. artemisiifolia . Artemisia and Ambrosia pollen in ambient air was collected (1996â��2013) by a Hirst type volumetric trap sited at roof level (33 m). Results : The SPT showed that the prevalence of sensitization to Ambrosia and Artemisia pollen exceeded 3.5, and 10.5, respectively. The measurements of IgE in blood serum (CAP-FEIA) revealed that among Ambrosia -sensitized patients 90.1 (20/22 patients) were concomitantly sensitized to Artemisia . 59.1 (13/22) of these patients reacted to nArt v 1, suggesting primary sensitization to Artemisia pollen. Only 2 (9.1) patients were mono-sensitized to Ambrosia pollen extract, but surprisingly not to nAmb a 1 . Conclusions : The LDT Ambrosia pollen had a negligible effect on the rate of sensitization to Ambrosia allergens in Poznan and did not increase the prevalence of sensitization to Artemisia pollen in this region. However, the majority of patients showing hypersensitization to Artemisia pollen might also present symptoms during elevated episodes of LDT of Ambrosia pollen.
Community Palliative Care Clinical Nurse Specialists as Independent Prescribers: Part 1	The Department of Health and Social Care has recently reiterated its commitment to improvement in the quality of end-of-life care and emphasised the importance of all patients having rapid access to medication. The aim of this study was to explore the lived experiences of clinical nurse specialists who are able to prescribe the lived experiences of clinical nurse specialists who are able to prescribe independently in their role in providing support for patients with palliative care needs within the community setting. Interpretative phenomenology was employed in order to understand and interpret the experiences of six nurse specialists. This purposive sampling was preferred with semi-structured  interviews as the most appropriate data collection technique. This is the first of a two-part aritcle. In this part, the authors describe how the study was undertaken. Part 2 will provide the results, outline the key themes that were extracted from the study, and discuss them. It will be published in the next issue of the Journal.
Editorial: Spaces of Religious and Values Education	It is the remit of this journal to publish research relating to religious and values education in contemporary schools and classrooms and within religious institutions. But what of the many ubiquitous but neglected spaces of religious and values education outside of these contexts, in the cultural and public spaces of society, through organisations founded by or allied to religion, or through the media? I offer the following as examples.
Synthetic Phonics and Decodable Instructional Reading Texts: How Far Do These Support Poor Readers?	This paper presents data from a quasi-experimental trial with paired randomisation that emerged during the development of a reading scheme for children in England. This trial was conducted with a group of 12 children, aged 5–6, and considered to be falling behind their peers in reading ability and a matched control group. There were two intervention conditions (A: using mixed teaching methods and a high percentage of non-phonically decodable vocabulary; P: using mixed teaching methods and low percentage of non-decodable vocabulary); allocation to these was randomised. Children were assessed at pre- and post-test on standardised measures of receptive vocabulary, phoneme awareness, word reading, and comprehension. Two class teachers in the same school each selected 6 children, who they considered to be poor readers, to participate (n = 12). A control group (using synthetic phonics only and phonically decodable vocabulary) was selected from the same 2 classes based on pre-test scores for word reading (n = 16). Results from the study show positive benefits for poor readers from using both additional teaching methods (such as analytic phonics, sight word vocabulary, and oral vocabulary extension) in addition to synthetic phonics, and also non-decodable vocabulary in instructional reading text.
The Comic Power of Ken Kiff's Sequence	The British painter Ken Kiff (1935-2001) emerged as a powerful force in figurative painting during the 1970s and 80s. He worked as associate artist at the National Gallery in 1993. He has, since this time, drifted from attention and is in some circles considered something of a parochial figure.  Most available writing on this artist focuses on the formal aspects of his work; colour and composition. Kiff himself often deflected conversation around the narrative content of his imagery. This article presents a reconsideration of the comic power of Kiff’s paintings with particular attention on the Sequence, a series of works on paper that Kiff made alongside his wider practice for the duration of his career.  The article is part of an initiative, with the collector John Talbot to bring together the Sequence in its entirety (some 130 pictures) for the first time in an internationally significant exhibition.

Critical Review of Research Evidence of Parenting Coordination’s Effectiveness	Parenting coordination (PC) has been in use since the mid-1980s, but research on its effectiveness is sorely lacking. We review the extant research organized by three themes: (1) parenting coordinators’ perceptions of their role and function; (2) professionals’ and parents’ views and perceptions of PC; and (3) outcomes of PC, including some measures of effectiveness of the PC process. While these studies provide some insight into PC effectiveness, there is still a lack of research that uses objective out- come measures of efficacy and that considers characteristics of the co-parent dyad, personality difficulties, or the professional discipline of the parenting coordinator. Future research recommendations are discussed.   Key Points for practitioners   • While parenting coordination (PC) is perceived by professionals to be effective, the research on PC effectiveness is limited by a small number of studies of variable quality; therefore there is no robust evidence of its effectiveness in practice.   • There is a need for research on PC effectiveness that considers parent engagement, conflict level, and personality variables as well as professional discipline of the parenting coordinator.  • While the Association for Family and Conciliation Courts and the American Psychological Association guidelines provide a model for PC practice, there is a distinct lack of theoretical underpinning of the PC practice.   • It is imperative for professionals and researchers to collaborate toward the development of a unified theoretical model to inform the PC role and practice, which in turn will allow objective assessment of its effectiveness.
'Was it worth it?' Intrathecal Analgesia for Cancer Pain: A Qualitative Study Exploring the Views of Family Carers	Background: Intrathecal drug delivery is known to reduce pain in patients where conventional systemic analgesia has been ineffective  or intolerable. However, there is little information regarding the effects of intrathecal drug delivery on quality of life and function in  those with advanced, incurable cancer.  Aim: Retrospective exploration of the views of bereaved carers regarding the physical and psychosocial effects of external tunnelled  intrathecal drug delivery in patients with advanced incurable cancer.  Design: Thematic analysis of qualitative interviews with carers of deceased individuals who received percutaneous external tunnelled  intrathecal drug delivery as part of their pain management, within two UK centres.  Setting: A total of 11 carers were recruited from two UK Palliative Care centres. Family carers of adult patients who had received  external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery analgesia for cancer pain and had died between 6 and 48 months prior to contact were  included. Carer relatives who were considered likely to be too vulnerable or who had lodged a complaint about treatment within the  recruiting department or who had been treated directly by the interviewer were excluded.  Results: In total, 11 interviews took place. The emerging themes were (1) making the decision to have the intrathecal – relatives  described desperate situations with severe pain and/or sedation, meaning that the individual would try anything; (2) timing and  knowing they were having the best – an increased access to pain and palliative care services, meant carers felt everything possible  was being done, making the situation more bearable; (3) was it worth it? – the success of the external tunnelled intrathecal drug  delivery was judged on its ability to enable the individual to be themselves through their final illness. Side effects were often considered  acceptable, if the external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery enabled improvements in quality of life.  Conclusion: Carers perceived external tunnelled intrathecal drug delivery as most valuable when it improved quality of life towards  the end of life, by reducing pain and side effects of conventional systemic analgesia to enable individuals ‘to be themselves’. Under these  circumstances, the carers judged significant side effects to be acceptable.Nishi Patel1, Melanie Huddart2, Helen Makins1, Theresa Mitchell3,  Jane L Gibbins2, Juan Graterol4, Deborah Stevens2  and Paul Perkins5
Association Between Schizophrenia-Related Polygenic Liability and the Occurrence and Level of Mood-Incongruent Psychotic Symptoms in Bipolar Disorder	Importance   Bipolar disorder (BD) overlaps schizophrenia in its clinical presentation and genetic liability. Alternative approaches to patient stratification beyond current diagnostic categories are needed to understand the underlying disease processes/mechanisms.  Objectives  To investigate the relationship between common-variant liability for schizophrenia, indexed by polygenic risk scores (PRS) and psychotic presentations of BD, using clinical descriptions which consider both occurrence and level of mood-incongruent psychotic features.  Design  Case-control design: using multinomial logistic regression, to estimate differential associations of PRS across categories of cases and controls.  Settings & Participants   4399 BD cases, 2966 (67%) female, mean age-at-interview 46 [sd 12] years, from the BD Research Network (BDRN) were included in the final analyses. For comparison genotypic data for 4976 schizophrenia cases and 9012 controls from the Type-1 diabetes genetics consortium and Generation Scotland were included.  Exposure  Standardised PRS, calculated using alleles with an association p-value threshold < 0.05 in the second Psychiatric Genomics Consortium genome-wide association study of schizophrenia, adjusted for the first 10 population principal components and genotyping-platform.   Main outcome measure  Multinomial logit models estimated PRS associations with BD stratified by (1) Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC) BD subtypes (2) Lifetime occurrence of psychosis.(3) Lifetime mood-incongruent psychotic features and (4) ordinal logistic regression examined PRS associations across levels of mood-incongruence. Ratings were derived from the Schedule for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry interview (SCAN) and the Bipolar Affective Disorder Dimension Scale (BADDS).   Results   Across clinical phenotypes, there was an exposure-response gradient with the strongest PRS association for schizophrenia (RR=1.94, (95% C.I. 1.86, 2.01)), then schizoaffective BD (RR=1.37, (95% C.I. 1.22, 1.54)), BD I (RR= 1.30, (95% C.I. 1.24, 1.36)) and BD II (RR=1.04, (95% C.I. 0.97, 1.11)). Within BD cases, there was an effect gradient, indexed by the nature of psychosis, with prominent mood-incongruent psychotic features having the strongest association (RR=1.46, (95% C.I. 1.36, 1.57)), followed by mood-congruent psychosis (RR= 1.24, (95% C.I. 1.17, 1.33)) and lastly, BD cases with no history of psychosis (RR=1.09, (95% C.I. 1.04, 1.15)).   Conclusion  We show for the first time a polygenic-risk gradient, across schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, indexed by the occurrence and level of mood-incongruent psychotic symptoms.
Fathers as Sexuality Educators: Aspirations and Realities. An Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis	Men can play a significant role in teaching their children about  sexuality but fathers’ practices and perceptions in this domain  remain under explored. This study presents an Interpretative  Phenomenological Analysis of eight fathers’ perceptions and practices  in educating their ten-year-old children about physical maturation,  reproduction and relationships. A Foucauldian analysis with a focus on  governmentality and biopower revealed tensions and contradictions  between the fathers’ aspirations and their realities, which appeared  to be underpinned by the dynamic, contradictory, shifting, plural  nature of fatherhood identities. Whilst fathers wished to adhere to the  cultural imperative for father–child emotional closeness, a disparity  between their ambitions and their conduct emerged. Care appeared  to be a deeply gendered concept for the fathers and despite their  aspirations for an intimate relationship with their children, gendered  norms for motherhood and fatherhood prevailed resulting in passivity  in their role as sexuality educators. The study concludes by arguing  that challenges to structures and subcultural contexts, which may  deter fathers from fully engaging with their sons and daughters in  this aspect of communication are required.
Empathy Leads to Increased Online Charitable Behaviour When Time is the Currency	This study shows how the empathy-altruism hypothesis can affect helping behaviour where time spent is the currency, through the novel use of a real world charity. Using an online charity task (www.freerice.com) we show that inducing empathy and also anger cause participants to spend more time donating rice to the United Nations World Food Programme. These findings therefore supports the empathy-altruism hypothesis, and adds to previous research that have mainly used artificial and/or hypothetical scenarios by further showing that its effects can be applied to real world scenarios where helping behaviours are beneficial.
Pain, Gain - Mission	We present a short conceptual framework as an opinion piece for considering learning gain based on Biesta’s three domains of educational purpose: qualification, socialisation and subjectification. We invite readers to reflect on the perspectives given in relation to different institutions mission statements around teaching and learning, and consider if the focus on developing methods for measuring learning gain is premature, given the lack of consensus regarding the nature of the learning to be measured.
IMPlementation of A Relatives' Toolkit (IMPART study): An Iterative Case Study to Identify Key Factors Impacting on the Implementation of a Web-based Supported Self-management Intervention for Relatives of People with Psychosis or Bipolar Experiences in a National Health Service: A Study Protocol	Background: Web-based interventions to support people to manage long-term health conditions are available and effective but rarely used in clinical services. The aim of this study is to identify critical factors impacting on the implementation of an online supported self-management intervention for relatives of people with recent onset psychosis or bipolar disorder into routine clinical care and to use this information to inform an implementation plan to facilitate widespread use and inform wider implementation of digital health interventions. Methods: A multiple case study design within six early intervention in psychosis (EIP) services in England, will be used to test and refine theory-driven hypotheses about factors impacting on implementation of the Relatives' Education And Coping Toolkit (REACT). Qualitative data including behavioural observation, document analysis, and in-depth interviews collected in the first two EIP services (wave 1) and analysed using framework analysis, combined with quantitative data describing levels of use by staff and relatives and impact on relatives' distress and wellbeing, will be used to identify factors impacting on implementation. Consultation via stakeholder workshops with staff and relatives and co-facilitated by relatives in the research team will inform development of an implementation plan to address these factors, which will be evaluated and refined in the four subsequent EIP services in waves 2 and 3. Transferability of the implementation plan to non-participating services will be explored. Discussion: Observation of implementation in a real world clinical setting, across carefully sampled services, in real time provides a unique opportunity to understand factors impacting on implementation likely to be generalizable to other web-based interventions, as well as informing further development of implementation theories. However, there are inherent challenges in investigating implementation without influencing the process under observation. We outline our strategies to ensure our design is transparent, flexible, and responsive to the timescales and activities happening within each service whilst also meeting the aims of the project.

The ‘Difficult’ Relationship: Christine Brooke-Rose, Catholicism and Muriel Spark	Christine Brooke-Rose has often been regarded by critics and readers alike as  ‘difficult’ in the sense that her work seems to deliberately elude classification  and definitive labels. This tendency to eschew categorisation with her writing  has been well documented in academic criticism; however, most critics have  failed to recognise the displacement in her life as a contributory factor  informing the nature of her work. This essay considers Brooke-Rose’s  development as a writer through a biographical lens, not to reduce her to her  own experiences but rather to highlight her extraordinary life and the way  that it has impacted upon her work. This essay focusses upon her early  development as an author during the 1950s using the friendship she  established with Muriel Spark during this period and her frequent negotiation  of Catholicism as important biographical touchstones in an effort to enhance  the reader’s understanding of Brooke-Rose’s early development as an author.  It uses archival material alongside excepts from her novels to align the  author’s work with her biographical experiences. This is by no means a full  critical depiction of Brooke-Rose’s life or her relationship to Catholicism, but it  serves as an introduction to both in order to go some way towards  ‘demystifying her origins’.
Multigene Editing Via CRISPR/Cas9 Guided By a Single-sgRNA Seed in Arabidopsis	We report that a single-sgRNA seed is capable of guiding CRISPR/Cas9 to simultaneously edit multiple genes AtRPL10A, AtRPL10B and AtRPL10C in Arabidopsis. Our results also demonstrate that it is possible to use CRISPR/Cas9 technology to create AtRPL10 triple mutants which otherwise cannot be generated by conventional genetic crossing. Compared to other conventional multiplex CRISPR/Cas systems, a single sgRNA seed has the advantage of reducing off-target gene-editing. Such a single sgRNA seed-induced gene editing system might be also applicable to modify other homologous genes or even less-homologous sequences for multiple gene-editing in plants and other organisms.

Mapping Allergenic Pollen Vegetation in UK to Study Environmental Exposure and Human Health	Allergenic pollen is produced by the flowers of a number of trees, grasses and weeds found throughout the UK. Exposure to such pollen grains can exacerbate pollen-related asthma and allergenic conditions such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever). Maps showing the location of these allergenic taxa have many applications: they can be used to provide advice on risk assessments; combined with health data to inform research on health impacts such as respiratory hospital admissions; combined with weather data to improve pollen forecasting systems; or as inputs to pollen emission models. In this study we present 1 km resolution maps of 12 taxa of trees, grass and weeds found in the UK. We have selected the main species recorded by the UK pollen network. The taxa mapped in this study were: Alnus (alder), Fraxinus (ash), Betula (birch), Corylus (hazel), Quercus (oak), Pinus (pine) and Salix (willow), Poaceae (grass), Artemisia (mugwort), Plantago (plantain), Rumex (dock, sorrels) and Urtica (nettle). We also focus on one high population centre and present maps showing local level detail around the city of London. Our results show the different geographical distributions of the 12 taxa of trees, weeds and grass, which can be used to study plants in the UK associated with allergy and allergic asthma. These maps have been produced in order to study environmental exposure and human health, although there are many possible applications. This novel method not only provides maps of many different plant types, but also at high resolution across regions of the UK, and uniquely present 12 key plant taxa using a consistent methodology. To consider the impact on human health due to exposure of the pollen grains, it is important to consider the timing of pollen release, and its dispersal, as well as the effect on air quality, which is also discussed here.
Just How Important Is Ethics Within Early Childhood Research and Professionalism	In our centre, which specialises in early childhood care in a UK Higher Education Institute, we have developed an approach to student research that ensures that it is purposeful, caring, sensitive and, above all, ethical. Recently a colleague challenged this by suggesting that ‘ethical practice’ was not, necessarily, synonymous with ‘good practice’ as it was something that was not even considered by Ofsted, the Government body which assesses the quality of educational provision in the UK. In this discussion piece, I explore the role that ethics plays in both Early Childhood research and professionalism and argue that the absence of a term from a Government policy is no indication of its value. I also raise the question of how we might prove a causal link between ethical approaches and quality practice.
Do Patients Benefit from Orthognathic Surgery? A Systematic Review on the Effects of Elective Orthognathic Surgery on Psychosocial Functioning and Patient Satisfaction	The main purpose of this systematic review was to determine the current state of evidence regarding patient satisfaction with, and the impact of, orthognathic surgery on psychosocial functioning of patients 17 yr of age and older. A secondary aim was to determine whether individuals with psychiatric disorders and mental health conditions are more likely to be dissatisfied with the treatment outcome than those without. We systematically searched PubMed, PsycInfo, and Embase for relevant studies (up to 6 June 2016). After selection of articles we determined the Directness of Evidence (DoE) and Risk of Bias (RoB). We identified 3,948 studies (1,053 studies in Pubmed, 2,023 in Embase, and 872 in PsycInfo). Of these, 87 remained after screening of title and abstract, while after full-text screening only nine remained for DoE and RoB assessment. All nine studies had a high RoB and a low or moderate DoE. The quality of the methods of studies, published to date, on the effects of orthognathic surgery on patient satisfaction or the psychosocial impact carry a high RoB. Therefore, these do not allow inferences on the effects of orthognathic surgery on patient satisfaction or their psychosocial functioning. [Abstract copyright: © 2017 Eur J Oral Sci.]
Genome-wide Significant Locus for Research Diagnostic  Criteria Schizoaffective Disorder Bipolar Type	Studies have suggested that Research Diagnostic Criteria for Schizoaffective  Disorder Bipolar type (RDC-SABP) might identify a more genetically homogenous  subgroup of bipolar disorder. Aiming to identify loci associated with RDC-SABP, we  have performed a replication study using independentRDC-SABP cases (n = 144) and  controls (n = 6,559), focusing on the 10 loci that reached a p-value <10−5 for RDCSABP  in the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) bipolar disorder  sample. Combining theWTCCC and replication datasets by meta-analysis (combined  RDC-SABP, n = 423, controls, n = 9,494), we observed genome-wide significant  association at one SNP, rs2352974, located within the intron of the gene TRAIP on  chromosome 3p21.31 (p-value, 4.37 × 10−8). This locus did not reach genome-wide  significance in bipolar disorder or schizophrenia large Psychiatric Genomic  Consortium datasets, suggesting that it may represent a relatively specific genetic  risk for the bipolar subtype of schizoaffective disorder.
"Bedeviled Minds": Reflections on the History of Satanic Thoughts	In his classic account of Christian awakening, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners (1666),John Bunyan described how the Devil planted evil thoughts in his mind. The spiritual enemy assailed him with “whole floods of blasphemies,both against God, Christ and the scriptures”. These shocking ideas came with unbidden and terrible force; suddenly his mind would be “strangely snatched away” by thoughts that he could not control, which assailed him like “a mighty whirlwind”.
The Silencing Effects of the Childhood Innocence Ideal:  the Perceptions and Practices of Fathers in Educating  Their Children About Sexuality	This study employed Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis to explore eight fathers’ perceptions and practices in talking to their ten year old children about puberty, relationships and reproduction.  The fathers participated in face to face interviews which were analysed idiographically initially, followed by analysis at the group level.  Interpretations were then developed through critical application of a Foucauldian lens of governmentality and biopower.  The results revealed a tension between the fathers’ cognitions, accounts and behaviours.  Their practices were largely characterised by silence yet they reported positive attitudes towards children’s sexuality education and perceived themselves as equipped and willing to take on the role of sexuality educator.  They also reported enjoying open relationships with their children.    Interpretations centred on contradictions and conflict between the majority of the fathers’ aspirations and the compelling nature of the childhood innocence discourse as a technology of governmentality.  Whilst all of the fathers felt that it was in their children’s interests to learn about sexuality, all but one adhered to hegemonic protective discourses and unquestioningly integrated their normalising effects into their fathering practices which, it is argued, may paradoxically render their children more vulnerable both now and in the future.

The Emergence and Development of Association Football: Influential Sociocultural Factors in Victorian Birmingham	This article explores the interdependent, complex sociocultural factors that facilitated the emergence and diffusion of football in Birmingham. The focus is the development of football in the city, against the backdrop of the numerous social changes in Victorian Birmingham. The aim is to fill a gap in the existing literature which seemingly overlooked Birmingham as a significant footballing centre, and the ‘ordinary and everyday’ aspects of the game’s early progression. Among other aspects, particular heed is paid to the working classes’ involvement in football, as previous literature has often focused on the middle classes and their influence on and participation in organized sport. As the agency of the working classes along with their mass participation and central role in the game’s development is unfolded, it is argued that far from being passive cultural beings, the working classes, from the beginnings, actively negotiated the development of their own emergent football culture.
The Effect of EMDR and CBT on Low Self-esteem in a General Psychiatric Population: A Randomized Controlled Trial	Although low self-esteem has been found to be an important factor in the development and maintenance of psychopathology, surprisingly little is known about its treatment. This study investigated the effectiveness of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT), regarding their capacities in enhancing self-esteem in a general psychiatric secondary health care population. A randomized controlled trial with two parallel groups was used. Participants were randomly allocated to either 10 weekly sessions of EMDR (n = 15) or CBT (n = 15). They were assessed pre-treatment, after each session, post treatment and at 3 months follow-up on self-esteem (Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and Credibility of Core Beliefs), psychological symptoms (Brief Symptom Inventory), social anxiety, and social interaction (Inventory of Interpersonal Situations) (IIS). The data were analyzed using repeated measures ANOVA for the complete cases (n = 19) and intention-to-treat (n = 30) to examine differences over time and between conditions. Both groups, EMDR as well as CBT, showed significant improvements on self-esteem, increasing two standard deviations on the main parameter (RSES). Furthermore, the results showed significant reductions in general psychiatric symptoms. The effects were maintained at 3 months follow-up. No between-group differences could be detected. Although the small sample requires to exercise caution in the interpretation of the findings, the results suggest that, when offering an adequate number of sessions, both EMDR and CBT have the potential to be effective treatments for patients with low self-esteem and a wide range of comorbid psychiatric conditions.

Maternal Ruptures/Raptures: Leakages of the Real	Julia Kristeva describes the hallucinatory state between the real and the symbolic as rapture: “The rapture of the hallucination originates in the absence of boundaries between pleasure and reality, between truth and falsehood” (Kristeva, in Oliver 2002: 207). The real can only be accessed through this hallucinatory rapture:    Floating in isolation, this vision of an unnamed real rejects all nomination and any possible narrative. Instead it remains enigmatic, setting the field of speech ablaze only to reduce it to cold ashes, fixing in this way a hallucinatory and untouchable jouissance. (Kristeva 1986: 227)    The symbolic order of language is described by Kristeva as ‘cold ashes’, a mere residue of the flames of the real. The real according to Kristeva remains untouchable, a notion similar to Lacan’s “encounter with the real”, which is always “a missed encounter” (Lacan 2004 [1977]: 55). The 2,000 word provocation proposed for Performance Research will argue that the maternal in performance has the capacity to set representation ablaze, to rupture the symbolic and to infuse performance with the rapturous sparks of the real. The provocation will utilise Zoo Indigo’s PaR performances Under the Covers (2009), which presents the performers’ babies via live video link, and Blueprint (2012), featuring the performers’ real-life mothers on SKYPE video call, as case studies to argue that the non-performance of motherhood can enable the emergence of the real in theatre.    Kristeva depicts motherhood as the maternal time, “the slow, difficult and delightful apprenticeship in attentiveness, gentleness, forgetting oneself” (Kristeva 1981: 31). Lisa Baraitser describes these interruptions as “breaches, tears or puncturings to the mother’s durational experiences bringing her back “again and again” into the realm of the immediate, the present, the here-and-now of the child or infant’s demand” (Baraitser 2009: 110).  This immediacy responding to the corporeal urges of the child render the maternal encounter real. This provocation aims to argue that the maternal encounter in Zoo Indigo’s performances causes a transcendence towards the real, with reference to psychoanalysis, specifically the writings by Julia Kristeva and Lisa Baraitser. Kristeva notes: “Milk and tears […] are the metaphors of nonspeech, of a ‘semiotics’ that linguistic communication does not account for” (Kristeva, in Oliver 2002: 322). The release of breast milk is beyond the symbolic order, it transports us to Kristeva’s semiotic, the non-symbolic, the real. The provocation will analyse the leakage of breast milk in Under the Covers, when performers experienced the let-down reflex and release of milk when seeing their babies on screen, and the leakage of tears in Blueprint, in the moments when mothers and daughters returned to a maternal encounter beyond the symbolic. The provocation will argue that real mother-child relationships in performance remain unperformed and beyond representation, and that the maternal fluids of blood, milk and tears erupting in Zoo Indigo’s work cause a momentary leakage of the real into the symbolic framework of theatre.
Effects of Dispersal Mode on the Environmental and Spatial Correlates of Nestedness and Species Turnover in Pond Communities	Advances in metacommunity theory have made a significant contribution to understanding the drivers of variation in biological communities. However, there has been limited empirical research exploring the expression of metacommunity theory for two fundamental components of beta diversity: nestedness and species turnover. In this paper, we examine the influence of local environmental and a range of spatial variables (hydrological connectivity, proximity and overall spatial structure) on total beta diversity and the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity for the entire macroinvertebrate community and active and passively dispersing taxa within pond habitats. High beta diversity almost entirely reflects patterns of species turnover (replacement) rather than nestedness (differences in species richness) in our dataset. Local environmental variables were the main drivers of total beta diversity, nestedness and turnover when the entire community was considered and for both active and passively dispersing taxa. The influence of spatial processes on passively dispersing composition, total beta diversity and nestedness was significantly greater than for actively dispersing taxa. Our results suggest that species sorting (local environmental variables) operating through niche processes was the primary mechanism driving total beta diversity, nestedness and turnover for the entire community and active and passively dispersing taxa. In contrast, spatial factors (hydrological connectivity, proximity and spatial eigenvectors) only exerted a secondary influence on the nestedness and turnover components of beta diversity.
Towards a Map of the European Tree Cover based on Sentinel-2	Many areas of science and policy depend on knowledge of  the tree cover in Europe. Sentinel-2 is a new (launched in  2015) satellite with a higher spatial resolution compared to  previous satellites. In the present study a new algorithm for  mapping tree cover from Sentinel-2 is developed, an analysis  of which bands should be used for tree cover mapping is  made, the accuracy of the mapping is assessed, and the tree  cover from the present approach is compared with previous  estimates. Firstly, the feasibility of the present algorithm is  demonstrated. Secondly, it is shown that only ten band  combinations have good performance in four selected  Sentinel-2 tiles and that the bands 3, 5, 6, 12 appear in most  combinations. Thirdly, the accuracy is assessed to be high,  and lastly it is shown that the relative difference between the  tree cover of the present study and the tree cover of previous  studies is between -14% and 68%
To Embed or not to Embed? A Longitudinal Study Exploring the Impact of Curriculum Design on the Evidence-based Practice Profiles of UK Pre-registration Nursing Students	Background  The use of Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) is increasingly emphasised within healthcare. However, little research has focused on nurses’ pre-registration training; particularly regarding the impact of curriculum-design on learning EBP.    Objectives  This study compared the impact of embedding EBP throughout the curriculum, with modular-based teaching, on pre-registration nursing students’ EBP profiles.    Design  A longitudinal panel study.    Settings and participants  A convenience sample of fifty-six pre-registration nursing students (55.4% studying an embedded EBP-curriculum and 44.6% studying a modular EBP-curriculum), were recruited from a UK University between 2011 and 2014.     Methods  Participants completed the Student Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire (S-EBPQ) in the first, second and third year of their course. This questionnaire measures four EBP domains: frequency of use, attitude, knowledge and skills in retrieving and reviewing evidence, and knowledge and skills in applying and sharing evidence.     Results  Two-way mixed between-within Analyses of Variance revealed significant improvements across all domains, except attitude (which remained broadly positive across all years), for both curriculum-groups.    No significant differences in this improvement were identified between the two curricula overall. However, the direction and rate of change of scores on the retrieving and applying subscales (but not frequency of use) for the two groups differed across time; specifically those on the embedded curriculum showed a dip in scores on these subscales in year 2. This appeared to be related to associated features of the course such as the timing of placements and delivery of theory.    Conclusions  Taking a modular or embedded approach to EBP may have little impact on students’ final EBP profiles. However, careful consideration should be given to the timing of related course features which may play a key role in students’ perceptions of their knowledge and skills in its application. Further research should explore how curriculum-design might build on students’ initial positive attitudes towards EBP and its use in their practice.
Comparison of Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing Therapy, Cognitive Behavioural Writing Therapy, and Wait-list in Pediatric Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Following Single-incident Trauma: a Multicenter Randomized Clinical Trial	Background: Practice guidelines for childhood posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) recommend trauma-focused psychotherapies, mainly cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy is a brief trauma-focused, evidence-based treatment for PTSD in adults, but with few well-designed trials involving children and adolescents. Methods: Weconducted a single-blind, randomized trial with three arms (n = 103): EMDR (n = 43), Cognitive Behavior Writing Therapy (CBWT; n = 42), and wait-list (WL; n = 18). WL participants were randomly reallocated to CBWT or EMDR after 6 weeks; follow-ups were conducted at 3 and 12 months posttreatment. Participants were treatment-seeking youth (aged 8–18 years) with a DSM-IV diagnosis of PTSD (or subthreshold PTSD) tied to a single trauma, who received up to six sessions of EMDR or CBWT lasting maximally 45 min each. Results: Both treatments were well-tolerated and relative to WL yielded large, intent-to-treat effect sizes for the primary outcomes at posttreatment: PTSD symptoms (EMDR: d = 1.27; CBWT: d = 1.24). At posttreatment 92.5 of<br/>EMDR, and 90.2 of CBWT no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD. All gains were maintained at follow-up. Compared to WL, small to large (range d = 0.39–1.03) intent-to-treat effect sizes were obtained at posttreatment for negative trauma-related appraisals, anxiety, depression, and behavior problems with these gains being maintained at follow-up. Gains were attained with significantly less therapist contact time for EMDR than CBWT (mean = 4.1 sessions/140 min vs. 5.4 sessions/227 min). Conclusions: EMDR and CBWT are brief, trauma-focused treatments that yielded equally large remission rates for PTSD and reductions in the severity of PTSD and comorbid difficulties in children and adolescents seeking treatment for PTSD tied to a single event. Further trials of both treatments with PTSD tied to multiple traumas are warranted.
Are Perceptions of Disability Changed by Involving Service Users and Carers in Qualifying Health and Social Work Training?	This article reports the findings of two small-scale qualitative studies at an English University which engaged service users and carers (SUACs) as researchers in co-production with an academic researcher. Findings were that SUAC participants reported considerable level of self-transformation via involvement in training health and social work professionals. Students reported heightened empathy and having had their perceptions about disability challenged. Further reserach regarding whether any learned values and attitudes regarding disability are carried through to the world of practice is recommended.
States, Territory and Sovereignty	The global political map displays a world composed of apparently discretely divided territorial units or states. This paints a deceptively static and solid picture that masks considerable fluidity and contestation. Drawing on a range of examples, this article explores the key geographical features of states through a discussion of territory, borders, sovereignty and identity, themes that have particular salience in light of the results of the 2016 UK referendum to leave the European Union. The idea of territory is bound up with the evolution of the state. Alongside this, borders have emerged as states have endeavoured to demarcate their territory rigidly from that of others. Sovereignty, or the right of a state to rule over its territory, has always been a contested and contingent idea. States also seek to create and reproduce senses of national identity among their citizens.
Editorial	There is a strong sense that we live in challenging times, politically, economically, environmentally and geographically.  The  fact that there are multiple periods in history,  both recent and longer ago, where the same  notion could be applied does not help pupils  who are growing up in a time of uncertainty.  Indeed, I remember growing up in the  early 1970s and the thrill of having to cook  and eat by candlelight because of power  cuts and the three day working week
Life Stories of International Romanian Adoptees: A Narrative Study	This study sought to explore the life stories of Romanian adoptees who were internationally adopted following the fall of communism in 1989. Ten participants were recruited via social media and took part in a life stories interview. Data were analysed using narrative analysis, which led to the development of four life chapters centred around identity construction: Chapter 1: Setting the scene – The adoption story; Chapter 2: Constructing the self; Chapter 3: Who am I? Quest for self-discovery; and Chapter 4: Negotiating the selves. Clinical implications, research limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.
Searching for Masculine Capital: Experiences Leading to High Drive for Muscularity in Men	Studies on the drive for muscularity (DFM) have primarily been quantitative, focused on identifying correlates. Currently little is known about men’s experiences leading them to desire high levels of muscle and engage in behaviours to increase their masculine capital. Our purpose was to explore the stories of men with high DFM revealing the socio-cultural and personal factors leading to DFM and their search for masculine capital. In-depth life-history interviews and multiple in-the-field conversations were undertaken with twenty men (Mean age=28.45, SD=6.96, years) scoring ≥ 3 on the Drive for Muscularity Scale (Mean=4.30, SD=0.70). Men’s stories focused on a set of dysfunctional childhood and adolescent socio-cultural interactions, including forms of symbolic violence, between them and significant others. In these interactions men were exposed to dominant social narratives of masculinity, and through comparisons and reinforcement they identified discrepancies between themselves and these narratives. In late adolescence and early adulthood men came to believe that they lacked masculine capital. Men struggled to increase their masculine capital through engagement with other traditional masculine activities (e.g., sport) and driven by activating events, they compensated through DFM desires and behaviours. This study advances knowledge by revealing the socio-cultural and personal processes participants believed led to their high DFM. Findings disclose that men’s search for masculine capital may have led them to develop and maintain high levels of DFM.
Appropriateness Assessment and Identifying the Risk Factors of Oral Non-prescription Drugs Use Among University Students in the United Arab Emirates	Irrational use of drugs has a serious impact on health and the economy. The use of oral non-prescription drugs is increasing among university students worldwide. The objective of the present study is to measure the prevalence of use of oral-non-prescription drugs, assess appropriateness of this use, and identify factors associated with inappropriate use among students. A cross-  sectional study used anonymous self-administered questionnaire over the period of four months (January, 2014 to April, 2014). More than half (1348; 57%) of participants reported the use of ONPD in the past 90 days before study  commencement. Of 1,348, participants reported using ONPD; only 8% were inappropriate ONPD users for self-treating the last recent symptom. The present study identified three newly reported risk factors for the outcome. Polypharmacy behaviour was a significant predictor variable (OR = 2.457, 95% CI: 1.380-4.373, p=0.002), safety belief in the use of ONPD (OR= 1.702, 95% CI: 1.070-2.709, p≤0.05) and medication knowledge (OR= 0.608, 95% CI: 0.380-0.972, p≤0.05). There is high prevalence of ONPD use among university students in UAE. However, the majority of this use was found to be appropriate. To promote healthy ONPD use in university students, awareness campaign is  needed in all universities and must stress on the potential dangers of drug addict, drug abuse and polypharmacy behavior.
Exploring the Current Working Profiles of Nutritional Therapists to Inform Curriculum and Professional Development	Introduction: Nutritional therapy (NT) since the mid-1980s has undergone a process of professional, regulatory  and educational development. To inform the continuance of this process the Nutritional Therapy Education  Commission (NTEC) initiated an exploration of practitioner profiles.  The aim was to ensure NTEC are meeting these developmental requirements by: informing a revised Core  Curriculum; ensuring an evidence-based approach to professional training; establishing appropriateness of ‘fit’  between qualification and subsequent occupation and clarifying possible barriers to, or reasons for non-continuance  of practice.  Methods: An anonymous online survey recruited 408 qualified nutritional therapists in the UK, Numerical data  were analysed descriptively and statistically using SPSS (Statistical Package for the Social Science).  Results: The majority of the respondents were female, aged between 31 and 50 years and working part time, in  self-employed clinical practice; almost a third of these earning a primary income. The current training provision  appears to be adequate, however further training needs were identified. Barriers to practice maybe income  driven or personal for a minority, however further research is needed.  The majority were registered with the voluntary regulator and were members of a professional body with a  range of continuing professional development strategies. Functional medicine approaches were reported to be  widely incorporated into practice and awareness of the role of nutrigenomics was common, but clinical application  of nutrigenetic testing was less widespread.  Conclusion: The findings suggest that in the captured population current NT education and professional provision  results in clinical practice however there are areas for further development.
SMEs Attitudes to “Information Assurance” and Consequences for the Digital Single Market	It is now generally accepted that cyber crime represents a big threat to organisations, and that they need to take appropriate action to protect their valuable information assets.  However, current research shows that, although small businesses understand that they are potentially vulnerable, many are still not taking sufficient action to counteract the threat.    Last year, the authors sought, through a more generalised but categorised attitudinal study, to explore the reasons why smaller SMEs in particular were reluctant to engage with accepted principles for protecting their data. The results showed that SMEs understood many of the issues. They were prepared to spend more but were particularly suspicious about spending on information assurance.     The authors’ current research again focuses on SME attitudes but this time the survey asks only questions directly relating to information assurance and the standards available, in an attempt to try to understand exactly what is causing them to shy away from getting the badge or certificate that would demonstrate to customers and business partners that they take cyber security seriously.     As with last year’s study, the results and analysis provide useful pointers towards the broader business environment changes that might cause SMEs to be more interested in working towards an appropriate cyber security standard.
How Does Cryotherapy Effect Ankle Proprioception in Healthy Individuals?	Objectives: To investigate how a 15 minute Cryotherapy intervention effects proprioception by measuring Joint positional Sense (JPS) and static single legged balance. Design: Repeated measures design. Setting: Laboratory. Participants: Eighteen healthy university sports team students (11 males, 7 females) aged between 20-21 years. Main Outcome Measures: Participants were treated with 15 minutes Aircast Cryo-cuff. The subject’s skin temperature was measured before and immediately after 15 minutes Cryotherapy treatment. Ankle active joint positional sense (A-JPS) and passive joint positional sense (P-JPS) was measured at pre-test, immediately post-test and 5 minutes post-test. Static balance was measured by Centre of Pressure (CoP) mean path length, medial-lateral (ML) CoP mean Deviation and anterior-posterior (AP) CoP mean Deviation and mean time-to-boundary (TtB) Minima for AP and ML directions. Results: No significant differences found for the variables of JPS and static single balance testing after 15 minutes Cryotherapy treatment. However, mean differences for CoP mean path length and ML mean deviation were shown to improve following Cryotherapy treatment, results not previously found in the literature. Conclusion: Results suggest that 15 minute Cryo-cuff treatment doesn’t significantly affect proprioception. Although the effect of Cryotherapy on proprioception depends on cooling modality used, time frame applied and joint applied to.
The Hive at Five: From Design to Delivery	The Hive in Worcester is home to Europe’s first integrated public and university library, Worcestershire’s Archives & Archaeology Service and Worcestershire County Council’s Customer Service Hub. Having celebrated our fifth birthday in July 2017, this article presents an opportune moment to reflect on the original vision and how the innovative design has helped us to transform both university and county library services in Worcester.
Can Early Years’ Practitioners Facilitate Social Development During Conflicts Between Young Children?	This small-scale case study concerned the role of early years’ practitioners in managing conflict events between peers aged three to five in an early childhood setting in England. The setting is located in an area with a higher than average socio-economic status. The cohort which comprised the subject of the study reflected diverse ethnic and linguistic backgrounds. All children were culturally European and one child was bilingual. The study aimed to identify pedagogy which optimised children’s agency, thereby potentially, supporting the development of skills in the social domain. Accordingly, the focus of the study was on conflict management rather than its resolution. The pedagogical approach at the setting was informed by a social constructivist perspective and strategies drawn from alternative dispute resolution (ADR) practices typical of adult mediation services. The practitioner researcher’s professional background included both early years’ practice and ADR with adults. A principle of mediation is that the parties in conflict own and manage the process themselves whilst a mediator facilitates by optimising communication and managing power imbalances rather than directing or imposing judgment. Findings indicated that where practitioners used mediation strategies, (including non-intervention), children rehearsed social skills. In the majority of conflict events, children were able to manage their conflicts without adult support. In every conflict event where adult support was given, children rehearsed social skills.

A Study of Global Hospital Websites for Accessibility Compliance	The research investigated accessibility problems of 160 hospital websites, located in 16 countries across 4 continents using Tawdis accessibility software tool. Statistics were analyzed from two layers of WCAG guidance, levels A and AAA, revealing a high incidence of problems at both levels. Asian hospital websites had the greatest number of accessibility issues, although the vast majority of sites in all countries had some type of issues. Only two of the hospital websites included in the study were fully Level A compliant. The study concludes that hospitals are not doing an adequate job of complying with accessibility standards or government legislation, thus depriving many of their web customers the ability to fully use the sites.
Editorial: Regulation of Endurance Performance: New Frontiers	Successful endurance performance requires the integration of multiple physiological and psychological systems, working together to regulate exercise intensity in a way that will reduce time taken or increase work done. The systems that ultimately limit performance of the task are hotly contested, and may depend on a variety of factors including the type of task, the environment, external influences, training status of the individual and a host of psychological constructs. These factors can be studied in isolation, or inclusively as a whole-body or integrative system. A reductionist approach has traditionally been favored, leading to a greater understanding and emphasis on muscle and cardiovascular physiology, but the role of the brain and how this integrates multiple systems is gaining momentum. However, these differing approaches may have led to false dichotomy, and now with better understanding of both fields, there is a need to bring these perspectives together.

Effect of New Zealand Blackcurrant Extract on Performance During the Running Based Anaerobic Sprint Test in Trained Youth and Recreationally Active Male Football Players	It was observed previously that New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract reduced slowing of the maximal 15 m sprint speed during the Loughborough Intermittent Shuttle Test. We examined the effect of NZBC extract on the performance of the Running Based Anaerobic Sprint Test (RAST, 6 × 35-m sprints with 10 seconds passive recovery) in trained youth and recreationally active football players. Fifteen recreationally active (University team) (age: 20 ± 1 years, height: 174 ± 19 cm, body mass: 80 ± 13 kg) and nine trained youth players (English professional club) (age: 17 ± 0 years, height: 178 ± 8 cm, body mass: 69 ± 9 kg, mean ± SD) participated in three testing sessions. Prior to the RASTs, participants consumed two capsules of NZBC extract (600 mg?day?1 CurraNZ®) or placebo (P) for 7 days (double blind, randomised, cross-over design, wash-out at least 14 days). Ability difference between groups was shown by sprint 1 time. In the placebo condition, trained youth players had faster times for sprint 1 (5.00 ± 0.05 s) than recreationally active players (5.42 ± 0.08 s) (p < 0.01). In trained youth players, there was a trend for an effect of NZBC extract (p = 0.10) on the slowing of the sprint 1 time. NZBC extract reduced slowing of the sprint 5 time (P: 0.56 ± 0.22 s; NZBC: 0.35 ± 0.25, p = 0.02) and this was not observed in recreationally active players (P: 0.57 ± 0.48 s; NZBC: 0.56 ± 0.33, p = 0.90). For fatigue index, expressed as a % change in fastest sprint time, there was a strong trend to be lower in both trained youth and recreationally active players combined by NZBC extract (P: ?13 ± 7%; NZBC: ?11 ± 6%, p = 0.06) with 12 participants (five trained youth) experiencing less fatigue. New Zealand blackcurrant extract seems to benefit repeated sprint performance only in trained football players.
The effects of improving sleep on mental health (OASIS): a randomised controlled trial with mediation analysis	Background  Sleep difficulties might be a contributory causal factor in the occurrence of mental health problems. If this is true, improving sleep should benefit psychological health. We aimed to determine whether treating insomnia leads to a reduction in paranoia and hallucinations.    Methods  We did this single-blind, randomised controlled trial (OASIS) at 26 UK universities. University students with insomnia were randomly assigned (1:1) with simple randomisation to receive digital cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for insomnia or usual care, and the research team were masked to the treatment. Online assessments took place at weeks 0, 3, 10 (end of therapy), and 22. The primary outcome measures were for insomnia, paranoia, and hallucinatory experiences. We did intention-to-treat analyses. The trial is registered with the ISRCTN registry, number ISRCTN61272251.    Findings  Between March 5, 2015, and Feb 17, 2016, we randomly assigned 3755 participants to receive digital CBT for insomnia (n=1891) or usual practice (n=1864). Compared with usual practice, the sleep intervention at 10 weeks reduced insomnia (adjusted difference 4·78, 95% CI 4·29 to 5·26, Cohen's d=1·11; p<0·0001), paranoia (−2·22, −2·98 to −1·45, Cohen's d=0·19; p<0·0001), and hallucinations (−1·58, −1·98 to −1·18, Cohen's d=0·24; p<0·0001). Insomnia was a mediator of change in paranoia and hallucinations. No adverse events were reported.    Interpretation  To our knowledge, this is the largest randomised controlled trial of a psychological intervention for a mental health problem. It provides strong evidence that insomnia is a causal factor in the occurrence of psychotic experiences and other mental health problems. Whether the results generalise beyond a student population requires testing. The treatment of disrupted sleep might require a higher priority in mental health provision.
The Self-care Approach to Healthcare	The article examines the role of self-care within the healthcare services industry. It emphasises the broad scope of self-care and some of the factors which are causing governments and healthcare services providers to encourage increasing levels of self-care. Specific forms of self-care are illustrated. Some of the approaches available to healthcare services providers for facilitating self-care are discussed.
Identifying Risk Factors for Incautious Use of Non-Prescription Drugs Among Higher Education Institutions' Students in Emirates	Objective: The aim of this research is to identify risk factors for incautious use of oral non-prescription drugs (ONPD) and inform recommendations that promote cautious ONPD use among HEI students in the UAE. Methods: A cross-sectional survey-based study was conducted with 2875 students in three randomly selected UAE universities between January and April 2014. Results: More than half (1348; 57) of participants reported using of ONPD in the past 90 days before study commencement. Of 1348 participants reported using ONPD, one-quarter (1348; 22.2) of ONPD was classified as incautious ONPD usage. Analgesic/antipyretic (84.9), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (1028; 76.3), and cough and cold drugs (562; 41.7) were reported by the majority of participants as the most commonly used ONPD. 10 risk factors were identified for incautious ONPD use. Participants with age group of 21 years and older (OR=0.554, 95; CI=0.373-0.823; p<0.001), female (OR=0.339, 95; CI=0.236-0.486; p<0.001), and students from medical schools (OR=0.619, 95; CI=0.435-0.882; p=0.008) had lower odds of being incautious users compared to lower age group, males, and students from non-medical schools. Furthermore, participants with a polypharmacy behavior had higher odds of being irresponsible ONPD user than monopharmacy users (OR=1.400, 95; CI=1.030- 1.02; p<0.001). Conclusion: One of five students is an incautious ONPD user. There is a need for an educational and behavioral intervention to motivate students to be cautious users. Â© 2017 The Authors.
Sleep Loss as a Trigger of Mood Episodes in Bipolar Disorder: Individual Differences Based on Diagnostic Subtype and Gender	Background: Sleep loss may trigger mood episodes in people with bipolar disorder (BD) but individual differences could influence vulnerability to this trigger.    Aims: To determine whether bipolar subtype (BD-I or BD-II) and gender were associated with vulnerability to the sleep loss trigger.    Method: During a semi-structured interview, 3140 individuals (68% female) with BD (66% BD-I) reported whether sleep loss had triggered episodes of high or low mood. DSM-IV diagnosis of bipolar subtype was derived from case note and interview data.    Results: Sleep loss triggering episodes of high mood was associated with female gender (OR = 1.43, 95% CI 1.17-1.75, P <.001) and BD-I subtype (OR = 2.81, 95% CI 2.26-3.50, P <.001). Analyses on sleep loss triggering low mood were not significant following adjustment for confounders.     Conclusions: Gender and bipolar subtype may increase vulnerability to high mood following sleep deprivation. This should be considered in situations where patients encounter sleep disruption, such as shift-work and international travel.
Modelled and Observed Surface Soil Pollen Deposition Distance Curves for Isolated Trees of Carpinus Betulus, Cedrus Atlantica,  Juglans nigra and Platanus Acerifolia	Source–distance relationships for pollen deposited directly into surface soil have been rarely undertaken, particularly for a single or isolated source, rather than a forest, grove or plantation. This study aimed to determine surface soil pollen deposition patterns from single, isolated source trees and to compare the results to Gaussian model curves for the same trees. Four isolated tree pollen sources were chosen in Worcester, UK: Carpinus betulus, Cedrus atlantica, Juglans nigra and Platanus acerifolia. Surface soil samples were collected at 1, 5 and thenevery 10 m, up to 100 m distance from the main trunk of each source along the prevailing wind direction  during flowering. A Gaussian dispersion model was used to estimate source strength using tree height and width and wind speeds on days when flowering was occurring and when the wind direction flowed along the sampling transect. This model simulated the expected concentration and deposition along the sampling transect. Modelled and observed results showed that most pollen was deposited beneath the canopy (range 63–94%) in an exponentially decreasing curve and the tailing off started from around the outer edge of the canopy in most cases. The amount of  pollen deposited at 50 m was no more than 2.6% of total deposition in the samples for any tree and at 100 m no more than 0.2%. Tree height, width and wind speed during the pollination period were found to be the main parameters affecting deposition away from the source.
Source Regions of Ragweed Pollen Arriving in South – Western Poland and the Influence of Meteorological Data on the HYSPLIT Model Results	We have investigated the relationship between the inflow of air masses and the ragweed pollen concentration in SW Poland (Wrocław) for a 10-year period of 2005-2014. The HYSPLIT trajectory model was used to verify if episodes of high concentrations can be related to regions outside of the main known ragweed centres in Europe, like Pannonian Plain, northern Italy and Ukraine. Furthermore, we used two different meteorological data sets (the global GDAS data set and from the WRF mesoscale model; the meteorological parameters were: U and V wind components, temperature and relative humidity) into HYSPLIT to evaluate the influence of meteorological input on calculated trajectories for high concentration ragweed episodes. The results show that the episodes of high pollen concentration (above 20 pm-3) represent a great part of total recorded ragweed pollen in Wrocław, but occur rarely and not in all years. High pollen episodes are connected with air masses coming from south and south-west Europe, which confirms the existence of expected ragweed centres but showed that other centres near Wrocław are not present. The HYSPLIT simulations with two different meteorological inputs indicated that footprint studies on ragweed benefit from a higher resolution meteorological data sets.
Recommended Terminology for Aerobiological Studies	Aerobiology is an interdisciplinary science where researchers with different backgrounds are involved in different topics related to microorganism, airborne biological particles, e.g. pollen and spores, and phenology. Some concepts, words or expressions used in aerobiology have a clear definition, but are however frequently misused. Therefore, the working group “Quality Control” of the European Aerobiology Society (EAS) and the International Association of Aerobiology (IAA) would like to clarify some of them, their use and presentation.
Play in Middle Childhood: Everyday Play Behaviour and Associated Emotions	Children’s reports about their play in middle childhood and the emotions they associate with play have received limited research attention. Using focus groups, this study asked 38 children in the UK about what, where and with whom they played. They were also asked how play made them feel. Children reported a wide range of play behaviours, with outdoor and traditional games being just as prominently mentioned as play with electronic devices. The emotional importance of play in middle childhood was apparent, with children associating play with strong positive emotions, and not being able to play with negative emotions and anxiety.
The Worldwide Spread, Success, and Impact of Ragweed (Ambrosia spp.)	ABSTRACTThe Ambrosia species represent one of the most problematic groups of invasive weeds around the world. The ease with which they are introduced and spread in new countries, their generalist ecological requirements, and functional traits facilitate their invasion and subsequent naturalization in new areas. All of these aspects contribute to increasing their global social and economic impact, which is mostly related to pollen allergy. Here we analyze available scientific publications about Ambrosia artemisiifolia, A. psilostachya, A. tenuifolia, and A. trifida, with the aim of defining the current level of knowledge and summarizing important data that are currently scattered throughout the literature. Specifically, we analyzed the following: (1) their current global distribution and current stage of invasion; (2) traits and requirements promoting their introduction, reproductive success, and adaptation to climate and environment in the nonnative range; as well as (3) current knowledge about allergens and elements increasing their impact.
Are Estimates of Wind Characteristics Based on Measurements with Pitot Tubes and GNSS Receivers Mounted on Consumer-grade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Applicable in Meteorological Studies?	The objective of this paper is to empirically show that estimates of wind speed and wind direction based on measurements carried out using the Pitot tubes and GNSS receivers,  mounted on consumer-grade unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), may accurately approximate true wind parameters. The motivation for the study is that a growing number of commercial and scientific UAV operations may soon become a new source of data on wind speed and wind direction, with unprecedented spatial and temporal resolution. The feasibility study was carried out within an isolated mountain meadow of Polana Izerska located in the Izera Mountains (SW Poland) during an experiment which aimed to compare wind characteristics measured by several instruments: three UAVs (swinglet CAM, eBee, Maja) equipped with the Pitot tubes and GNSS receivers, wind speed and direction meters mounted at 2.5 m and 10 m (mast), conventional weather station and vertical sodar. The three UAVs performed seven missions along spiral-like trajectories, most reaching 130 m above take-off location. The estimates of wind speed and wind direction were found to agree between UAVs. The time series of wind speed measured at 10 m were extrapolated to flight altitudes recorded at a given time so that a comparison was made feasible. It was found that the wind speed estimates provided by the UAVs on a basis of the Pitot tube/GNSS data are in agreement with measurements carried out using dedicated meteorological instruments. The discrepancies were recorded in the first and last phases of UAV flights.
Effects of Wind Speed and Direction on Monthly Fluctuations of Cladosporium Conidia Concentration in the Air	This study determined the relationship between airborne concentration of Cladosporium spp. spores and wind speed and direction using real data (local wind measured by weather station) and modelled data (air mass flow computed with the aid of HYbrid Single Particle Lagrangian Trajectory model). Air samples containing fungal conidia were taken at an urban site (Worcester, UK) for a period of five consecutive years using a spore trap of the Hirst design. A threshold of ≥6000 s m−3 (double the clinical value) was applied in order to select high spore concentration days, when airborne transport of conidia at a regional scale was more likely to occur. Collected data were then examined using geospatial and statistical tools, including circular statistics. Obtained results showed that the greatest numbers of spore concentrations were detected in July and August, when C. herbarum, C. cladosporioides and C. macrocarpum sporulate. The circular correlation test was found to be more sensitive than Spearman’s rank test. The dominance of either local wind or the air mass on Cladosporium spore distributions varied between examined months. Source areas of this pathogen had an origin within the UK territory. Very high daily mean concentrations of Cladosporium spores were observed when daily mean local wind speed was vs ≤ 2.5 m s−1 indicating warm days with a light breeze.
Delusional Ideation, Cognitive Processes and Crime Based Reasoning	Probabilistic reasoning biases have been widely associated with levels of delusional belief ideation (Galbraith, Manktelow & Morris, 2011; Lincoln, Ziegler, Mehl, & Rief, 2010; Speechley, Whitman, & Woodward, 2009; White & Mansell, 2009), however, little research has focused on biases occurring during every day reasoning (Galbraith, Manktelow & Morris, 2011), and moral and crime based reasoning (Wilkinson, Jones & Caulfield, 2011; Wilkinson, Caulfield & Jones, 2014). 235 participants were recruited across four experiments exploring crime based reasoning through different modalities and dual processing tasks. Study one explored delusional ideation when completing a visually presented crime based reasoning task.  Study two explored the same task in an auditory presentation. Study three utilised a dual task paradigm to explore modality and executive functioning. Study four extended this paradigm to the auditory modality. The results indicated that modality and delusional ideation have a significant effect on individuals reasoning about violent and non-violent crime (p<0.05), which could have implication for the presentation of evidence in applied setting such as the courtroom.
A New Functional Method to Choose the Target Lobe for Lung Volume Reduction in Emphysema - Comparison with the Conventional Densitometric Method	Lung volume reduction (LVR) improves breathing mechanics by reducing hyperinflation. Lobar selection usually focuses on choosing the most destroyed emphysematous lobes as seen on an inspiratory CT scan. However, it has never been shown to what extent these densitometric CT parameters predict the least deflation of an individual lobe during expiration. The addition of expiratory CT analysis allows measurement of the extent of lobar air trapping and could therefore provide additional functional information for choice of potential treatment targets.To determine lobar vital capacity/lobar total capacity (LVC/LTC) as a functional parameter for lobar air trapping using on an inspiratory and expiratory CT scan. To compare lobar selection by LVC/LTC with the established morphological CT density parameters.36 patients referred for endoscopic LVR were studied. LVC/LTC, defined as delta volume over maximum volume of a lobe, was calculated using inspiratory and expiratory CT scans. The CT morphological parameters of mean lung density (MLD), low attenuation volume (LAV), and 15th percentile of Hounsfield units (15%P) were determined on an inspiratory CT scan for each lobe. We compared and correlated LVC/LTC with MLD, LAV, and 15%P.There was a weak correlation between the functional parameter LVC/LTC and all inspiratory densitometric parameters. Target lobe selection using lowest lobar deflation (lowest LVC/LTC) correlated with target lobe selection based on lowest MLD in 18 patients (50.0%), with the highest LAV in 13 patients (36.1%), and with the lowest 15%P in 12 patients (33.3%).CT-based measurement of deflation (LVC/LTC) as a functional parameter correlates weakly with all densitometric CT parameters on a lobar level. Therefore, morphological criteria based on inspiratory CT densitometry partially reflect the deflation of particular lung lobes, and may be of limited value as a sole predictor for target lobe selection in LVR.
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy vs. Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing for Treating Panic Disorder: A Randomized Controlled Trial	Objective: Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an effective intervention for patients with panic disorder (PD). From a theoretical perspective, Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy could also be useful in the treatment of PD because: (1) panic attacks can be experienced as life threatening; (2) panic memories specific to PD resemble traumatic memories as seen in posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD); and (3) PD often develops following a distressing life event. The primary objective of this Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), was to compare EMDR therapy with CBT for PD and determine whether EMDR is not worse than CBT in reducing panic symptoms and improving Quality Of Life (QOL). Methods: Two-arm (CBT and EMDR) parallel RCT in patients with PD (N = 84). Patients were measured at baseline (T1), directly after the last therapy session (T2), and 3 months after ending therapy (T3). Non-inferiority testing (linear mixed model with intention-to-treat analysis) was applied. Patients were randomly assigned to 13 weekly 60-min sessions of CBT (N = 42) or EMDR therapy (N = 42). Standard protocols were used. The primary outcome measure was severity of PD at T3, as measured with the Agoraphobic Cognitions Questionnaire (ACQ), the Body Sensations Questionnaire (BSQ), and the Mobility Inventory (MI). The secondary outcome measure was QOL, as measured with the World Health Organization Quality of Life short version (WHOQOL-Bref), at T3. Results: The severity of PD variables ACQ and BSQ showed non-inferiority of EMDR to CBT, while MI was inconclusive (adjusted analyses). Overall QOL and general health, Psychological health, Social relationships, and Environment showed non-inferiority of EMDR to CBT, while Physical health was inconclusive. Conclusion: EMDR therapy proved to be as effective as CBT for treating PD patients. Trial Registration: Dutch Trial Register, Nr. 3134 http://www.trialregister.nl/trialreg/admin/rctview.asp?TC=3134.
The Role of PTSD in Bi-directional Intimate Partner Violence in Military and Veteran Populations: a Research Review	Evidence supporting the higher prevalence of PTSD linked to combat-related trauma in military personnel and veteran populations is well-established. Consequently, much research has explored the effects that combat related trauma and the subsequent PTSD may have on different aspects of relationship functioning and adjustment. In particular, PTSD in military and veterans has been linked with perpetrating intimate partner violence (IPV).  New research and theoretical perspectives suggest that in order to respond effectively to IPV, a more accurate understanding of the direction of the violence experienced within each relationship is critical. In both civilian and military populations, research that has examined the direction of IPV’s, bi-directional violence have been found to be highly prevalent. Evidence is also emerging  as to how these bi-directional violence differ in relation to severity, motivation, physical and psychological consequences and risk factors. Of particular importance within military IPV research is the need to deepen understanding about the role of PTSD in bi-directional IPV not only as a risk factor for perpetration but also as a vulnerability risk factor for victimization, as findings  from recent research suggest.  This paper provides a timely, critical review of emergent literature to disentangle what is known about bi-directional IPV patterns in military and veteran populations and the roles that military or veterans’ PTSD may play within these patterns. Although this review aimed to identify global research on the topic, the majority of research meeting the inclusion criteria was from US, with only one study identified from outside, from Canada. Strengths and limitations in the extant research are identified. Directions for future research are proposed with a particular focus on the kinds of instruments and designs needed to better capture the complex interplay of PTSD and bi-directional IPV in military populations and further the development of effective interventions.
The Impact of Cross Cultural Communication on Collective Efficacy in NCAA Basketball Teams	This research contributes to the knowledge and theory on cross cultural communication by investigating the impact of cross cultural communication competence on the collective efficacy of multicultural National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball teams. Data was collected from 140 U.S. National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball coaches via the Cross Cultural Communication Competence Questionnaire and the Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sports. Principle component analysis was conducted on the data, revealing that the cross cultural communication competence and collective efficacy of basketball teams are multidimensional.  The hypothesized relationship between cross cultural communication competence and collective efficacy was confirmed and statistically measured through regression analysis. It was found that four of the cross cultural communication competence dimensions produced by the principle component analysis exhibited a significant positive relationship with one of the two dimensions within collective efficacy. Given the well-supported relationship between collective efficacy and team performance in business, this study produces important implications for scholars and practitioners working with multicultural sporting teams.
The iPad Project: Introducing iPads into Care Homes in the UK to Support Digital Inclusion	There are an estimated 5,153 nursing homes and 12,525 residential homes in the UK with around 426,000 residents of whom 80% have some form of dementia or memory problem. Only 38% of staff working in residential and domiciliary  services say they use technology in direct work with residents. Objectives The objectives of this study were to (i) explore the experiences and potential benefits and barriers of iPad use in 63 care homes for residents with dementia, their family/friends and care staff; (ii) develop recommendations based on different ways in which iPads can be used in care settings and what needs to be in place to support their successful introduction and usages. Method A mixed methods approach based on data from staff interviews and a self-administered questionnaire, resident case studies, family interviews and observation of activity sessions. Results The main findings were: (i) iPads provided a flexible and adaptable means of engaging residents, their relatives and staff in both one-to-one and  group sessions; (ii) iPads offered a new means to increase social interaction and resident engagement. Conclusion Systematic incremental implementation of the use of iPads in  a care home can help promote digital inclusion for both residents and staff and participation by family members.
Rudimentary Lexicon Based Method for Sarcasm Detection	The purpose of this paper is to establish if rudimentary methods can be used for classifying text as being sarcastic using data taken from the social media website, Twitter. Data collection for this study was carried out using text extracted from Twitter. It applies string matching against positive sentiment and interjection lexicons to test if the presence of both can be used to classify content as being sarcastic.   The result shows that the most frequently used terms are too generic to be suitable for a sarcasm specific lexicon. It further shows that Boolean matches to two lexicons are suitable for classification of text as being sarcastic.  This is significant as many methods require significant time in collecting and analysing the data to be used within the classification process, as well as complex algorithms to conduct the task. By using simplistic processes, it is hoped that some of the challenges related to performance are overcome. Additionally, this study is the precursor to planned further research into sarcasm detection methods.
Private Military and Security Labour Migration: the Case of Fiji	Private military and security companies (PMSCs) are a fast-growing global industry. While the rise of PMSCs and their activities have attracted much media coverage and growing scholarly attention, little is known about their sourcing of masses of military labour from the global South. This exploratory study examines the case of Fiji, whose thousands of ex/current disciplinary force personnel and unemployed men have been contracted by PMSCs to provide security work in Iraq and other high-conflict areas. The article shows this to be an instance of unequal core-periphery military labour trade, outlining its scale, processes and impacts on the migrants. It also illuminates how the migrants’ collective agency is demonstrated even under powerful structural constraints.
Scholarly Commentary: Prioritising Practice Education through Collaborations	The critical importance of practice education in occupational therapy to graduate outcomes and preparedness for practice is well recognised (Doherty, Stagnitti, & Schoo, 2009; Gray et al., 2012; Holmes et al., 2010) being referred to as the bridge between academic education and occupational  therapy practice (Roberts, Hooper, Wood, & King, 2015). It is also the foundation on which graduates make career choices and develop as professional occupational therapists. Recognition of the importance of practice education is evidenced through a growing international collection of  published research into both innovative models and the pedagogy of practice education (Roberts et al., 2015).

Ethnographic Chats: A ‘Best of Both’ Method for Ethnography	Conventionally, ethnographic methods aim to discover how language works as ‘situated  social practice and how it is tied to social organisation’ (Heller 2011: 10). Within this,  ethnography has viewed participant observation as central and essential. More recently  ethnographers have moved to combine this with more structured, researcher-facilitated  question-based tools such as ethnographic interviews (Spradley 1979) and focus groups. This  article reports on a creative method, aiming to bring together the strengths of both these  approaches to access school-age young people’s orientations to language education policies.  There were three main motivations: firstly to minimise the distracting influence of the  researcher’s presence; and to aid in empowering participants, encouraging them into an active  role in the research process; and to avoid favorability bias in participant responses. On the  latter point, to truly value the voice of participants you have to find creative ways to move  beyond the ‘right answer’. This often requires pushing methodological boundaries in new or  creative ways. Building on prior approaches I developed a new protocol, ‘ethnographic  chats’, which I found offered the ‘best of both’: a compromise between the immersive depth  of participant observation and the greater thematic focus of focus groups or ethnographic  interviews. The method was characterised by specific procedural and interactional  characteristics of frame and genre, which differentiate it from ethnographic interview and  focus group methods in specific ways. Rich data emerged from this process, which would not  otherwise have been available. I conclude by outlining the potential for ethnographic chats in  other social and geographical contexts.

Subaerial Gravel Size Measurement Using Topographic Data Derived From a UAV-SfM Approach	Fluvial grain size plays a fundamental role in determining the condition and availability of aquatic habitats. Remote sensing provides rapid and objective methods of quantifying fluvial grain size, and typically provide coarse grain size outputs (c. 1m) at the catchment scale (up to 80km channel lengths) or fine resolution outputs (c. 1mm) at the patch scale (c. 1m2). Recently, drone based approaches have started to fill the gap between these scales, providing hyperspatial resolution data (<10cm) over reaches up to a few hundred metres in length. This ‘mesoscale’ is of importance to habitat assessments and is aligned with the ideals of the ‘Riverscape’ concept. Most drone based grain size measurement approaches use textural variables computed from drone orthoimagery. To date however, no published works provide quantitative evidence of the success of this approach, despite significant differences in platform stability and the image quality obtained by manned aircraft versus drones. With interest in drone surveys growing rapidly, such error quantification is essential for making reliable, evidence-based recommendations about the suitability of drones for routine management of fluvial environments. Here we provide an initial assessment of the accuracy and precision of grain size estimates produced using two different drone-based methods; (1) the image textural variable ‘negative entropy’, and; (2) the roughness of point clouds derived from drone imagery processed using structure from motion photogrammetry. Data is collected from a small gravel-bed river in Cumbria, UK. Results from jack knife analyses show that the point cloud roughness method gives more accurate and precise measures of grain size at this site, as indicated by the mean (0.0002m) and standard deviation (0.0184m) of residual errors. However, both methods struggle to provide grain size measures with sub-centimetre precision. We suggest that blur within the drone imagery prevents better precision, resulting from an inadequate camera gimbal.
Enriching the Historiography of Religious Education: Insights from Oral Life History	This article seeks to exemplify the extent to which oral life history research can enrich existing historiographies of English Religious Education (RE). Findings are reported from interviews undertaken with a sample of key informants involved in designing and/or implementing significant curriculum changes in RE in the 1960s and 1970s. The interviews provided insights into personal narratives and biographies that have been marginal to, or excluded from, the historical record. Thematic analysis of the oral life histories opened a window into the world of RE, specifically in relation to professional identity and practice, curriculum development, and professional organizations, thereby exposing the operational dynamics of RE at an (inter-)personal and organizational level. The findings are framed by a series of methodological reflections. Overall, oral life histories are shown to be capable of revealing that which was previously hidden and which can be confirmed and contrasted with knowledge gleaned from primary documentary sources.
How Play Provision Enhances the Lives of Children in Refugee Camps	This is the third in a series of editorials written by   Alison Prowle and Janet Harvell from   the Centre for Early Childhood, University of Worcester, UK, on their experiences in the   Dunkirk Refugee Camp in France. (Sadly, the camp burned down in April.) The authors   explore how children in camps are being encouraged to play and through this, how they   are developing resilience, learning new skills, making friends and enjoying a respite from   the harsh realities of their lives.

Drones and Digital Photogrammetry: From Classifications to Continuums for Monitoring River Habitat and Hydromorphology	Recently, we have gained the opportunity to obtain very high-resolution imagery  and topographic data of rivers using drones and novel digital photogrammetric  processing techniques. The high-resolution outputs from this method are  unprecedented, and provide the opportunity to move beyond river habitat classification  systems, and work directly with spatially explicit continuums of data.  Traditionally, classification systems have formed the backbone of physical river  habitat monitoring for their ease of use, rapidity, cost efficiency, and direct comparability.  Yet such classifications fail to characterize the detailed heterogeneity  of habitat, especially those features which are small or marginal. Drones and  digital photogrammetry now provide an alternative approach for monitoring  river habitat and hydromorphology, which we review here using two case studies.  First, we demonstrate the classification of river habitat using drone imagery  acquired in 2012 of a 120 m section of the San Pedro River in Chile, which was at  the technological limits of what could be achieved at that time. Second, we  review how continuums of data can be acquired, using drone imagery acquired  in 2016 from the River Teme in Herefordshire, England. We investigate the precision  and accuracy of these data continuums, highlight key current challenges,  and review current best practices of data collection, processing, and management.  We encourage further quantitative testing and field applications. If current  difficulties can be overcome, these continuums of geomorphic and hydraulic  information hold great potential for providing new opportunities for understanding  river systems to the benefit of both river science and management.
Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy for Treatment of Dental Phobia	Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) has gained in popularity as an effective treatment for anxiety disorders. The purpose of this article is to determine the applicability of VRET in the treatment of dental phobia of two patients. Two case examples of female dental patients, aged 56 and 24 years, who met the criteria for dental phobia according to the Phobia Checklist, illustrate the use of VRET in the dental setting. VRET that is used as a psychological treatment for dental fear and dental phobia can potentially be given by a non-specialist (for example dental assistant), thereby making it a cost-effective therapy for the treatment of dental phobia. CPD/Clinical Relevance: This article is the first of its kind to demonstrate Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy (VRET) in the treatment of dental anxiety.
Genome-wide Association Study of Borderline Personality Disorder Reveals Genetic Overlap with Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression and Schizophrenia	Borderline personality disorder (BOR) is determined by environmental and genetic factors, and characterized by affective instability and impulsivity, diagnostic symptoms also observed in manic phases of bipolar disorder (BIP). Up to 20% of BIP patients show comorbidity with BOR. This report describes the first case–control genome-wide association study (GWAS) of BOR, performed in one of the largest BOR patient samples worldwide. The focus of our analysis was (i) to detect genes and gene sets involved in BOR and (ii) to investigate the genetic overlap with BIP. As there is considerable genetic overlap between BIP, major depression (MDD) and schizophrenia (SCZ) and a high comorbidity of BOR and MDD, we also analyzed the genetic overlap of BOR with SCZ and MDD. GWAS, gene-based tests and gene-set analyses were performed in 998 BOR patients and 1545 controls. Linkage disequilibrium score regression was used to detect the genetic overlap between BOR and these disorders. Single marker analysis revealed no significant association after correction for multiple testing. Gene-based analysis yielded two significant genes: DPYD (P=4.42 × 10−7) and PKP4 (P=8.67 × 10−7); and gene-set analysis yielded a significant finding for exocytosis (GO:0006887, PFDR=0.019; FDR, false discovery rate). Prior studies have implicated DPYD, PKP4 and exocytosis in BIP and SCZ. The most notable finding of the present study was the genetic overlap of BOR with BIP (rg=0.28 [P=2.99 × 10−3]), SCZ (rg=0.34 [P=4.37 × 10−5]) and MDD (rg=0.57 [P=1.04 × 10−3]). We believe our study is the first to demonstrate that BOR overlaps with BIP, MDD and SCZ on the genetic level. Whether this is confined to transdiagnostic clinical symptoms should be examined in future studies.
'It's Just More Acceptable to Be White or Mixed Race and Gay Than Black and Gay': The Perceptions and Experiences of Homophobia in St. Lucia	Lesbian, gay and bisexual (LGB) individuals come from diverse cultural groups with differing ethnic and racial identities. However, most research on LGB people uses white western samples and studies of Afro-Caribbean diaspora often use Jamaican samples. Thus, the complexity of Afro-Caribbean LGB peoples’ experiences of homophobia is largely unknown. The authors’ analyses explore experiences of homophobia among LGB people in St. Lucia. Findings indicate issues of skin-shade orientated tolerance, regionalized disparities in levels of tolerance towards LGB people and regionalized passing (regionalized sexual identity shifting). Finally, the authors’ findings indicate that skin shade identities and regional location influence the psychological health outcomes of homophobia experienced by LGB people in St. Lucia.
Parenting with PTSD: A Review of Research on the Influence of PTSD on Parent-child Functioning in Military and Veteran Families	Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is strongly associated with exposure to war related trauma in military and veteran populations. In growing recognition that PTSD may influence and be influenced by social support and family systems, research has begun to explore the effects that war related trauma and the ensuing PTSD may have on varied aspects of close relationship and family functioning. Far less research, however, has examined the influence of war-related PTSD on parent-child functioning in this population. This paper provides a timely review of emergent literature to examine the impacts that PTSD may have on parenting behaviors and children’s outcomes with a focus on studies of military and veterans of international conflicts since post-9/11. The review sheds light on the pathways through which PTSD may impact parent-child relationships, and proposes the cognitive-behavioral interpersonal theory of PTSD as a theoretical formulation and extends this to parenting/children. The review identifies the strengths and limitations in the extant research and proposes directions for future research and methodological practice to better capture the complex interplay of PTSD and parenting in military and veteran families.
Roles of Dicer-Like Proteins 2 and 4 in Intra- and Intercellular Antiviral Silencing	RNA silencing is an innate antiviral mechanism conserved in organisms across kingdoms. Such cellular defense involves DICER or DICER-LIKEs (DCLs) that process viral RNAs into small interfering (vsi)RNAs. Plants encode four DCLs which play diverse roles in cell-autonomous virus-induced RNA silencing (known as VIGS) against viral invasion. However, intracellular VIGS can spread between cells, and the genetic basis and involvement of vsiRNAs in non-cell autonomous VIGS remains poorly understood. Here using GFP as a reporter gene together with a suite of DCL RNAi transgenic lines, we show that in addition to well-established activities of DCLs in intracellular VIGS and vsiRNA biogenesis, DCL4 inhibits intercellular VIGS whilst DCL2 is required, likely along with DCL2-processed/dependent vsiRNAs and their precursor RNAs, for efficient VIGS trafficking from epidermal to adjacent cells. DCL4 imposed an epistatic effect on DCL2 to impede cell-to-cell spread of VIGS. Our results demonstrate previously unknown functions for DCL2 and DCL4 which may form a dual defensive frontier for intra- and intercellular silencing to double-protect cells from virus infection in Nicotiana benthamiana.
Outcomes-based Commissioning for Social Care in Extra Care Housing: is There a Future?	This paper outlines the recent history of strategic and operational commissioning in England  followed by a section on outcomes-based commissioning and its relevance for the planning and  delivery of care and support to residents in extra care housing.
Online Instructional Videos as a Complimentary Method of Teaching Practical Rehabilitation Skills for Groups and Individuals	Online instructional videos are becoming increasingly common within education. This study adopts a quasi-experimental 2 × 2 crossover design (control and experimental groups) to evaluate the efficacy of instructional videos to teach practical rehabilitation skills. The students performed practical sessions in class and were formatively assessed by their lecturers. The results demonstrate that the group effect was moderate with an effect size of 0.68, CI [0.04, 1.31]; the magnitude-based inferences indicate the probabilities the video was beneficial or trivial or harmful were 93.9% or 5.4% or 0.6%. The results of the study demonstrate that the instructional videos had a small to moderate beneficial effect on all assessed criteria.
Can the Revised UK Code Direct Practice?	The Nursing and Midwifery Council, the United Kingdom regulator of nursing and midwifery has recently revised its professional code of practice. This paper begins by arguing that a professional code must be capable of sustaining close reading and of action guidance. Using four exemplar clauses it is argued that the new revised code does not met this purpose. First, I show that in setting out requirements for consent and documentation, the meaning of the relevant clause has changed significantly during the editing process so that a literal reading of the final document bears little relation to established professional practice. Second, I argue that the clause concerning the nature of professional relationships has also been altered during the editing process so that it is inconsistent with other professional groups and established accounts of the professional nurse-patient relationship. Third, I argue that the clause concerning disclosure of confidential information, which survived revision and editing with its meaning intact is nevertheless factually incorrect and inconsistent with UK law and authoritative guidance.  Finally, fourth, I argue that use of the word ‘inappropriate’ is inappropriate as it amounts to meaningless circularity, discussed in relation to a clause on expressing personal beliefs. Taken together, these examples demonstrate that the Code is seriously flawed and does not fulfil its purpose.  One way that simple prescriptive clauses in the Code can be usefully understood is through the provision of detailed guidance. I argue that the NMC has changed its position on its view of the value of guidance and has significantly reduced the amount of written guidance and advice is provides. The paper concludes by arguing that in order to meet its action directing function, further clarifying revision and the provision of detailed guidance is required.
Do Traumatic Events Have More Impact on the Development of Dental Anxiety Than Negative, Non-traumatic Events?	The importance of exposure to traumatic events for the development of dental anxiety has not been investigated. The aim of the present study was to test the hypotheses that individuals who reported having been exposed to a traumatic event [that is, fulfilling Criterion A of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5), for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)] as the cause of their dental anxiety would report significantly higher levels of dental anxiety, typical trauma-related (PTSD) symptoms, and greater disturbance of memories involving these events than those who reported being exposed to non-traumatic events. Patients of a specialized dental fear clinic (n = 90) were divided into those who reported a traumatic event that initiated their dental trait anxiety and those who did not. The two groups did not differ in their severity of dental anxiety and number of PTSD symptoms, but the memories of those who had been exposed to traumatic events were significantly more vivid than the memories of those in the reference group. Length of time since the event took place did not play a role. Hence, traumatic events are remembered more vividly, but do not seem to initiate more severe forms of dental anxiety than other events.
Evaluating Promotional Approaches for Citizen Science  Biological Recording: Bumblebees as a Group Versus  Harmonia axyridis as a Flagship for Ladybirds	Over the past decade, the number of biological records submitted by members of the public have increased dramatically. However, this may result in reduced record quality, depending on how species are promoted in the media. Here we examined the two main promotional approaches for citizen science recording schemes: flagship-species, using one charismatic species as an umbrella for the entire group (here, Harmonia axyridis (Pallas) for Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), and general-group, where the group is promoted as a whole and no particular prominence is given to any one species (here, bumblebees, genus Bombus (Hymenoptera: Apidae)). Of the two approaches, the  general-group approach produced data that was not  biased towards any one species, but far fewer records  per year overall. In contrast, the flagship-species  approach generated a much larger annual dataset, but  heavily biased towards the flagship itself. Therefore,  we recommend that the approach for species promotion  is fitted to the result desired.
Dose Effects of New Zealand Blackcurrant on Substrate Oxidation and Physiological Responses During Prolonged Cycling.	Purpose     It has been previously shown that New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract increased fat oxidation during short duration cycling. The present study examined the effect of different doses of NZBC extract on substrate oxidation and physiological responses during prolonged cycling.   Methods  Using a randomized counterbalanced Latin square design, 15 endurance trained male cyclists (age: 38±12 yrs, height: 187±5 cm, body mass: 76±10 kg, V̇O2max: 56±8 mL∙kg-1∙min-1, mean±SD) completed four separate 120 minutes cycling bouts at 65% V̇O2max after ingesting no dose, or one of three doses (300, 600 or 900 mg∙day-1) of NZBC extract (CurraNZTM) for 7-days.   Results  A dose effect (P<0.05) was observed for average fat oxidation (0, 300, 600 and 900 mg∙day-1 values of 0.63±0.21; 0.70±0.17; 0.73±0.19 and 0.73±0.14 g∙min-1) and carbohydrate oxidation (0, 300, 600, 900 mg∙day-1 values of 1.78±0.51, 1.65±0.48, 1.57±0.44, and 1.56±0.50 g∙min-1). The individual percentage change of mean fat oxidation was 21.5% and 24.1% for 600 and 900 mg∙day-1 NZBC extract, respectively, compared to no dose. Heart rate, V̇O2, V̇CO2, plasma lactate and glucose were not affected.   Conclusion  Seven-days intake of New Zealand blackcurrant extract demonstrated a dose-dependent effect on increasing fat oxidation during 120 minutes cycling at 65% V̇O2max in endurance-trained male cyclists.
sIL-6R is Related to Weekly Training Mileage and Psychological Wellbeing in Athletes	Introduction: IL-6 has been ascribed both positive and negative roles in the context of exercise and training. The dichotomous nature of IL-6 signalling appears to be determined by the respective concentration of its receptors (both membrane-bound (IL-6R) and soluble (sIL-6R) forms). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the response of sIL-6R to long-term training, and to investigate the relationship between sIL-6R, self-reported measures of wellbeing, and upper respiratory illness symptoms (URS) in highly-trained endurance athletes. Methods: Twenty-nine athletes provided resting blood samples, and completed wellbeing and illness monitoring questionnaires, on a weekly basis for a period of 18 weeks during a winter training block. Results: URS were not correlated to concentrations of sIL-6R or cortisol, but there was a non-significant trend (P=0.08) for the most illness-prone athletes (as defined by self-reported illness questionnaire data) to exhibit higher average sIL-6R concentrations compared to the least ill (23.7±4.3 Vs 20.1±3.8 ng/ml). Concentrations of sIL-6R were positively correlated to subjective measures of stress (r=0.64, P=0.004) and mood (r=0.49, P=0.02), but were negatively correlated to sleep quality (r=-0.43, P=0.05) and cortisol concentration (r=-0.17, P=0.04). In a sub-group of 10 athletes, weekly training distance was quantified by coaching staff, and this negatively correlated with sIL-6R in the following week (r=-0.74, P<0.005). Conclusion: The findings of the current study suggest that sIL-6R is responsive to prolonged periods of exercise training, with sIL-6R levels varying related to the volume of training performed in the preceding week. Importantly, our data indicate that changes in sIL-6R levels could be linked to common symptoms of overreaching such as high levels of stress, and/or depressed mood.
Traversing the Services: a Constructivist Grounded Theory of Admission in Two Adult Acute Mental Health Inpatient Wards	Background  It is increasingly acknowledged that service-user satisfaction and experience are fundamental to the achievement of high quality care delivery worldwide.  Research in this area identifies a need, to capture the experience of care providers, to expand methodological approaches beyond the survey instrument, and to develop patient-centred approaches that include effective partnerships between professionals, patients and their carers or family members.  Evidence highlights the coercive potential of admission in adult acute mental health, and the increased complexity associated with enhancing patient satisfaction and experience in these environments.    Objective  This study aimed to explore the experiences of staff, service-users, and carers with admission in two adult acute inpatient mental health wards.     Methods  A grounded theory (GT) approach was adopted such that theory was developed inductively through data collection and analysis.  Results  A total of twenty-two participants were interviewed, this included: 9 (40%) service-users, 10 (46%) members of staff and 3 (14%) carers.  The substantive theory of admission produced was organised across three major categories, namely: a person-centred beginning; building relationships along the way and barriers to the service received.  These interrelated factors determine the meaningfulness of the admission and have the power to hinder or facilitate improvement to a service-user’s wellbeing and their evaluation of being admitted to an inpatient mental health ward.      Conclusion     The process of admission in an acute inpatient mental health environment can pre-determine satisfaction and experience with services.  It is essential that person-centred ideals are maintained from the outset in order to maximise the quality of care received.  This includes the implementation of strategies that facilitate involvement approaches and nurturing positive relationships to improve communication, concordance, shared decision-making and participation with care delivery.
Macroinvertebrate Community Composition and Diversity in Ephemeral and Perennial Ponds on Unregulated Floodplain Meadows in the UK	Ponds are common and abundant landscape features in temperate environments, particularly on floodplains where lateral connectivity with riverine systems persists. Despite their widespread occurrence and importance to regional diversity, research on the ecology and hydrology of temperate ephemeral and perennial floodplain ponds lags behind that of other shallow waterbodies. This study examines the aquatic macroinvertebrate diversity of 34 ponds (20 perennial and 14 ephemeral) on two unregulated riverine floodplain meadows in Leicestershire, UK. Perennial ponds supported nearly twice the diversity of ephemeral ponds. Despite frequent inundation of floodwater and connectivity with other floodplain waterbodies, ephemeral ponds supported distinct invertebrate communities when compared to perennial ponds. When the relative importance of physical and chemical, biological and spatial characteristics was examined, physical and chemical characteristics were found to account for more variation in community composition than biological or spatial variables. The results suggest that niche characteristics rather than neutral colonisation processes dominate the structure of invertebrate communities of floodplain ponds. The maintenance of pond networks with varying hydroperiod lengths and environmental characteristics should be encouraged as part of conservation management strategies to provide heterogeneous environmental conditions to support and enhance aquatic biodiversity at a landscape scale.
Benthic and Hyporheic Macroinvertebrate Distribution Within the Heads and Tails of Riffles During Baseflow Conditions	The distribution of lotic fauna is widely acknowledged to be patchy reflecting the interaction between biotic and abiotic factors. In an in-situ field study, the distribution of benthic and hyporheic invertebrates in the heads (downwelling) and tails (upwelling) of riffles were examined during stable baseflow conditions. Riffle heads were found to contain a greater proportion of interstitial fine sediment than riffle tails. Significant differences in the composition of benthic communities were associated with the amount of fine sediment. Riffle tail habitats supported a greater abundance and diversity of invertebrates sensitive to fine sediment such as EPT taxa. Shredder feeding taxa were more abundant in riffle heads suggesting greater availability of organic matter. In contrast, no significant differences in the hyporheic community were recorded between riffle heads and tails. We hypothesise that clogging of hyporheic interstices with fine sediments may have resulted in the homogenization of the invertebrate community by limiting faunal movement into the hyporheic zone at both the riffle head and tail. The results suggest that vertical hydrological exchange significantly influences the distribution of fine sediment and macroinvertebrate communities at the riffle scale.
"A Just and Honourable Commerce" Abolitionist Experimentation in Sierra Leone in the Late Eighteenth and Early Nineteenth Centuries	This article analyses the ways in which the Sierra Leone Company, a chartered trading company, attempted to persuade Africans to relinquish the slave trade in favor of an export trade in crops and other natural commodities. Company efforts to reform African economic activity led to increasing levels of travel and investigation on the upper Guinea coast in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The article examines how abolitionists constructed their case for reform in Britain, as well as the strategies deployed to implement  their plans on the coast of West Africa. With scant first-hand knowledge of Africa, the directors of the Sierra Leone Company relied on the testimony of European rather than African informants. As a result, Company plans devised  in London were misinformed and misdirected. From the early 1790s, Company employees based at Freetown undertook a series of short and long distance journeys to gather intelligence on the potential for cultivation and trade. Although Company ideas for the development of a “just and honourable commerce” were unsuccessful, their policies continued to influence debate on West Africa in the nineteenth century.
Ammonia Concentrations Over Europe – Application of the WRF-Chem Model Supported With Dynamic Emission	The study focuses on the application of a static and dynamic ammonia emission based on a Europe-wide default setting into the Weather Research and Forecasting Chemistry model (WRF-Chem) and the influence on the simulated ammonia concentrations and the overall model performance. The WRF-Chem model was run twice for the entire Europe at a spatial resolution of 36 x 36 km for the year 2012. In the first simulation we used a static emission approach (the “BASE” simulation), whereas in the second simulation, dynamic ammonia emissions were used (the “DYNAMIC” simulation). Both simulations underestimate measured concentrations of NH3 for all seasons, have similar NMGE (about 0.7 μg m-3) and modelled hourly ammonia peaks are shifted towards the afternoon hours if compared with measurements. However, for all temporal resolutions, normalised mean gross error in winter and summer is lower for DYNAMIC than for BASE. The DYNAMIC simulation also generally gives worse performance in spring for each temporal resolution. For further improvement of the modelled ammonia concentrations with WRF-Chem we suggest to use a nested approach with higher spatial resolution, which will lead to better separation of the ammonia source regions from surrounding areas, and take into account national practice and regulations in the emission model, eventually only in the nested model domain.
Blackcurrant Alters Physiological Responses and Femoral Artery Diameter During Sustained Isometric Contraction	Blackcurrant  is  rich  in  anthocyanins  that  may  affect  exercise-induced  physiological  responses. We examined tissue oxygen saturation, muscle activity, cardiovascular responses and   femoral artery diameter during a submaximal sustained isometric contraction. In a randomised,   double-blind, crossover design, healthy men (n = 13, age: 25 ± 4 years,  BMI: 25  ± 3 kg·m−2,  mean   ± SD) ingested New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract (600 mg·day−1 CurraNZ™) or placebo (PL) for   7-days separated by 14-days washout. Participants produced isometric maximal voluntary contractions   (iMVC) and a 120-s 30%iMVC of the quadriceps with electromyography (EMG), near-infrared   spectroscopy, hemodynamic and ultrasound recordings. There was no effect of NZBC extract on iMVC   (NZBC: 654 ± 73, PL: 650 ± 78 N). During the 30%iMVC with NZBC extract,  total peripheral   resistance, systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure were lower with increased cardiac   output and stroke volume. With NZBC extract, EMG root mean square of the vastus medialis and muscle   oxygen saturation were lower with higher total haemoglobin. During the 30%iMVC, femoral artery   diameter was increased with NZBC extract at 30 (6.9%), 60 (8.2%), 90 (7.7%) and 120 s (6.0%).   Intake of NZBC extract for 7-days altered cardiovascular responses, muscle oxygen saturation,   muscle activity and femoral artery diameter during a 120-s 30%iMVC of the quadriceps. The present   study provides insight into the potential mechanisms for enhanced exercise performance with intake  of blackcurrant.
Ethics - Do the Right Thing	As early years practitioners, it is important to remember that ethics is not something that we occasionally do, but is a way of being. In her work (2009), Professor Sarah Banks discusses how we need to reconsider the role of  ethics in our practice; that we should stop viewing it as a tick-box exercise and instead recognise it as something that permeates all of our actions. Throughout our working life, we should ‘be’ ethical professionals, not ‘do’ professional ethics.
The Reporting Cycle	The September/October 2016 edition of Financial Accountant launched a research project jointly undertaken by the University of Worcester and the IFA entitled Identifying the potential impacts of the new UK GAAP accounting standards FRS 102 and FRS 105 on small businesses and accountancy firms: a qualitative study. The project aimed to investigate how the accountancy profession had been affected by the transition to FRS 102: The Financial Reporting Standard applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland and FRS 105: The Financial Reporting Standard applicable to the Micro-Entities Regime. This is the first in a series of articles that present the findings of this research and provides support to IFA members in understanding the key changes, providing an overview of what is yet to come and explaining how to account for the more technically challenging areas of FRS 102 and FRS 105.

Effect of New Zealand Blackcurrant Extract on Repeated Cycling Time Trial Performance	Abstract: New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract increased 16.1 km cycling time trial performance.   The aim of the present study was to examine the effect of NZBC extract on 2 × 4 km time trial   performance. Ten male cyclists (age: 30 ± 12 years, body mass: 74 ± 9 kg, height: 179 ± 7 cm, body   fat: 11 ± 3%, V˙ O2max: 55 ± 7 mL·kg−1·min−1, mean ± SD) volunteered. Participants were   familiarized with the time trials. Participants consumed capsulated NZBC extract (300 mg·day−1   CurraNZ™; containing 105 mg anthocyanin) or placebo for seven days (double blind, randomised,   cross-over design, wash-out at least seven days) before 2 × 4 km time trials (10 min active   self-paced recovery between trials) (SRM ergometer, SRM International, Germany). Heart rate was   recorded and blood lactate sampled immediately after each trial and 8 min into recovery between the   trials. Times over comparable one km distances in each 4 km time trial were similar. No effect was   observed for the time to complete the first (placebo: 380 ± 28 s, NZBC: 377 ± 27 s) and second 4 km   of cycling (placebo: 391 ± 32 s, NZBC: 387 ± 30 s), within both groups the second 4 km times slower   by 11 ± 8 s and 11 ± 9 s for placebo and NZBC, respectively. However, the total time of the two 4   km cycling trials was 0.82% faster with NZBC extract (placebo: 771 ± 60 s, NZBC 764 ± 56 s, p =   0.034) with seven participants having faster total times. There was no effect of NZBC on heart rate   and lactate values at identical time points. New Zealand blackcurrant extract seems to be   beneficial in repeated  short-distance cycling time trials for overall performance.
Response to: ‘Don’t Let Kids Play Football’: a Killer Idea	In a recent BJSM editorial, it was stated that ‘shutting down youth sports programmes’ is not the answer to injury concerns in contact sport; suggesting there may be unintended consequences, such as increasing sedentary behaviour.1 With physical inactivity a leading cause of mortality, concerns about decreasing participation in physical activity are justified. This issue has even been discussed in a previous editorial in the BJSM.2 There is no evidence, however, to suggest that collision sports (specifically) are necessary to combat sedentary lifestyles of youth. There also continues to be a distinct misunderstanding of what has been called for in regards to the banning of tackling in school rugby, which will now be clarified.
Effect on Students from Attending a University Degree Programme Run in Partnership with Further and Higher Education Institutions	This paper considers the effect on students from attending a university foundation degree programme delivered in partnership with six further education teaching institutions in England. The programme is situated  within the early childhood education sector using an instructional design which promotes higher-level learning within the teaching institution and the workplace. Learning in one environment is aligned to the other. The  research process actively involved students and was conducted within ethical parameters approved by a university ethics committee. A qualitative methodology examined data drawn from focus groups, an online survey and  content analysis. Programme effect was seen as enhancing personal and professional capability and promoting higher-order learning. The findings go some way towards theorisation and documentation of programme effect  by identifying the influence of instructional design and extend knowledge about aligning the pace of teaching and learning with professional practice
Intensive EMDR to Treat Patients with Complex Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: A Case Series	There is mounting evidence suggesting that by increasing the frequency of treatment sessions, posttrau matic stress disorder (PTSD) treatment outcomes significantly improve. As part of an ongoing research project, this study examined the safety and effectiveness of intensive eye movement desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy in a group of seven (four female) patients suffering from complex PTSD and multiple comorbidities resulting from childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse, and/or work and combat-related trauma. Treatment was not preceded by a preparation phase and consisted of 2 x 4 consecutive days of EMDR therapy administered in morning and afternoon sessions of 90 minutes each, interspersed with intensive physical activity and psychoeducation. Outcome measures were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the PTSD Symptom Scale Self-report questionnaire (PSS-SR). During treatment, neither personal adverse events nor dropout occurred. CAPS scores decreased significantly from pre- to posttreatment, and four of the seven patients lost their PTSD diagnosis as established with the CAPS. The results were maintained at 3-month follow-up. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) on the CAPS and PSS-SR were large: 3.2, 1.7 (prepost) and 2.3, 2.1 (prefollow-up), respectively. The results of this case series suggest that an intensive program using EMDR therapy is a potentially safe and effective treatment alternative for complex PTSD. The application of massed, consecutive days of treatments using EMDR therapy for patients suffering from PTSD, particularly those with multiple comorbidities, merits more clinical and research attention.

The Sharing of Ballistics Data Across Europe and Neighbouring Territories	The current study explored the use of ballistic examinations and cross-border information sharing across 14 European countries. The presented data were collected using a mixed methods technique consisting of semi-structured interviews and questionnaires that were completed by participants. The results painted a very heterogeneous picture of the use of automated ballistic systems across these countries, as well as how ballistic analyses are integrated in the fight against gun-enabled crime. Three super-ordinates themes emerged from the thematic analysis: use of automated ballistic systems; Ballistic evidence recovery and analysis; knowledge exchange and best practices. The ability to draw firm conclusions regarding the value of ballistics comparison systems, either on a national or cross-border basis, is hampered by inconsistencies regarding data recording practices and definitions. Therefore, key recommendations are suggested to establish better cross border cooperation between member states and develop a better understanding of data sharing procedures.
Comparaison des Codes de Deontologie Selon Les Pays	In most countries, nursing ethics are set out in a code written by the body regulating the profession or by a professional organisation.An examination of these texts shows that differences exist from one country to another, both in terms of the general orientation and the content.
Venous Leg Ulcers in the UK: The Local Burden of Illness and the Allocation of Resources	The precise UK prevalence of venous leg ulcers (VLU) is currently unclear. Prevalence data is essential in order to calculate the costs and, to measure the impact of any therapeutic intervention. A review of the literature was undertaken to assess the prevalence and costs of VLU in order to collate available data for baseline, or comparative purposes. Thereafter, information on compression bandaging products obtained from the QuintilesIMS database, prescribed for one large city was collected and calculations made to estimate known prevalence in that geographic locality. Results from the literature search showed the prevalence to vary from 0.1 to 1.1 in the studies identified. The prevalence of leg ulcers (LUs) in compression in the city reviewed was calculated to be 0.1 in 2015. There is a lack of reliable information on the prevalence and cost of LUs. The estimated prevalence reported is in keeping with those calculated by SIGN (2010) but less than those reported by Guest et al (2016). The annual cost of treating patients with LUs in the UK has recently been reported to be Â£1,938 million (Guest et al, 2016). Traditionally, regional clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) and local health authorities have not requested prevalence and outcome data on LUs and, therefore, there is a gap in understanding the extent of the problem. Consequently, the budgeting of services by CCGs is based more on estimates than on prevalence data. Without more accurate prevalence data it is impossible to truly understand the scale of the problem and develop a plan on how best to move forward with improving LU care.

Values Based Practice: A Framework for Thinking With	Values are those principles that govern behaviours, and values-based practice has been described as a theory and skills base for effective healthcare decision-making where different (and hence potentially conflicting) values are in play. The emphasis is on good process rather than pre-set right outcomes, aiming to achieve balanced decision-making. In this article we will consider the utility of this model by looking at leadership development, a current area of much interest and investment in healthcare. Copeland points out that ‘values based leadership behaviors are styles with a moral, authentic and ethical dimension’, important qualities in healthcare decision-making.
The Occupational Wellbeing of People Experiencing Homelessness	This paper reports findings of a study that utilised an occupational perspective to explore how wellbeing was achieved and sustained by the occupations of people experiencing homelessness in Australia. Thirty three in-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with homeless individuals in a regional city in Australia. Data from the interviews were thematically analysed to understand the relationship between wellbeing, as defined by the individual, and the occupations engaged in by people experiencing homelessness. The findings are reported here as three collective narratives that illustrate the experiences of diverse groups within the homelessness population explored in this study. The study demonstrates how occupations go beyond the individual experience and choice; to explore the social and cultural value of occupations as a means to wellbeing. The findings are discussed in relation to three key themes that emerged from the study: survival, self-identity and social connectedness. These three interconnected concepts complement the existing occupational science literature, and offer a preliminary framework for understanding and improving wellbeing for disadvantaged and marginalised people where occupations are restricted by societal forces.  The findings support the urgent need to redirect services to support occupational opportunities that are socially and culturally valued and enhance survival, self-identity and connectedness of homeless people.
Comparison of the Adaptive Implementation and Evaluation of the Meeting Centers Support Program for People with Dementia and Their Family Carers in Europe; Study Protocol of the MEETINGDEM Project	Background  The MEETINGDEM study aims to implement and evaluate an innovative, inclusive, ap-proach to supporting community dwelling people with mild to moderate dementia and their family carers, called the Meeting Centers Support Program (MCSP), in three countries in the European Union (EU): Italy, Poland and United Kingdom. Demonstrated benefits of this person-centered approach, developed in The Netherlands, include high user satisfac-tion, reduced behavioral and mood problems, delayed admission to residential care, low-er levels of caregiving-related stress, higher carer competence, and improved collabora-tion between care and welfare organizations.    Methods  The project will be carried out over a 36 month period. Project partners in the three coun-tries will utilize, and adapt, strategies and tools developed in the Netherlands. In Phase One (month 1-18) activities will focus on establishing an initiative group of relevant organ-izations and user representatives in each country, exploring pathways to care and poten-tial facilitators and barriers to implementing the program, and developing country specific implementation plans and materials. In Phase Two (month 19-36) training will be provid-ed to organizations and staff, after which the meeting centers will be established and evaluated for impact on behavior, mood and quality of life of people with dementia and carers, cost-effectiveness, changes in service use, user satisfaction and implementation process.     Discussion  An overall evaluation will draw together findings from the three countries to develop rec-ommendations for successful implementation of MCSP across the EU. If the Meeting Cen-ters approach can be widely implemented, this could lead to major improvements in de-mentia care across Europe and beyond.
Continuing Professional Development for Physician Associates in Primary Care	The Physician Associate role is relatively new to the United Kingdom and is currently undergoing a  period of significant expansion. This includes an aim of 1000 PAs working in primary care by 2020.  The profession has specific continuing professional development requirements which need to  be addressed. These requirements can be met through the deployment of some well established  pedagogical strategies which are already in use for junior doctors and allied health professionals.
Occupational Disruption and Natural Disaster:  Finding a ‘New Normal’ in a Changed Context	Individuals affected by natural disasters can undergo critical life changes throughout the recovery process. With a forecast increase in frequency and impact of natural disasters, it is important to consider the occupational recovery process that individuals experience post-disaster. This qualitative descriptive study explored the experience of occupational disruption and occupational recovery of individuals after Cyclone Yasi struck a small, regional town in Northern Queensland, Australia. Nine semi-structured interviews from long-term residents of the town affected by Cyclone Yasi were conducted 2 years after the event. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and independently coded using thematic analysis by three researchers. Five interrelated themes were identified: Recovery occupations; Interruption to leisure and productive occupations; Reconstruction: A second disaster; Occupational liminality and A new normal. These themes point to a phased process of occupational recovery through which disaster survivors encounter numerous personal and contextual barriers, encumbering their return to re-engagement in meaningful occupational routines. The findings from this research offer insights into the support needs of both individuals and communities as they endeavour to overcome challenges associated with the recovery process.
Comparison of Group-based Outpatient Physiotherapy With Usual Care After Total Knee Replacement: a Feasibility Study For a Randomized Controlled Trial	Objective: To evaluate the feasibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial comparing group-based outpatient physiotherapy with usual care in patients following total knee replacement.  Design: A feasibility study for a randomized controlled trial.  Setting: One secondary-care hospital orthopaedic centre, Bristol, UK.  Participants: A total of 46 participants undergoing primary total knee replacement.  Interventions: The intervention group were offered six group-based exercise sessions after surgery. The usual care group received standard postoperative care. Participants were not blinded to group allocation.  Outcome measures: Feasibility was assessed by recruitment, reasons for non-participation, attendance, and completion rates of study questionnaires that included the Lower Extremity Functional Scale and Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score.   Results: Recruitment rate was 37%. Five patients withdrew or were no longer eligible to participate. Intervention attendance was high (73%) and 84% of group participants reported they were ‘very satisfied’ with the exercises. Return of study questionnaires at six months was lower in the usual care (75%) than in the intervention group (100%). Mean (standard deviation) Lower Extremity Functional Scale scores at six months were 45.0 (20.8) in the usual care and 57.8 (15.2) in the intervention groups.  Conclusion: Recruitment and retention of participants in this feasibility study was good. Group-based physiotherapy was acceptable to participants. Questionnaire return rates were lower in the usual care group, but might be enhanced by telephone follow-up. The Lower Extremity Functional Scale had high responsiveness and completion rates. Using this outcome measure, 256 participants would be required in  a full-scale randomized controlled trial.
Ostrich (Struthio camelus) Embryonic Development From 7 to 42 Days of Incubation	1. Hatching success of ostrich eggs is poor (50–60% of fertile eggs). The current study was designed to identify the timing of key stages in the development of the ostrich embryo.    2. Growth of both embryo and wing length during 42 d of incubation was comparable and approximately linear, with a more or less weekly doubling in size up to 35 d of incubation.    3. The embryo eye size increased more rapidly than beak length and reached a maximum of ~16.2 mm by 28 d of incubation, whereas beak length increased continuously until hatching at 42 d.    4. Linear regression equations were derived from morphometric measurements of embryos between 7 and 42 d.    5. Information stemming from these results can be used to estimate the age of dead-in-shell embryos in an attempt to identify timing of incubation problems that potentially result in low hatchability of fertile eggs.
Buffer Strip Management to Deliver Plant and Invertebrate Resources For Farmland Birds in Agricultural Landscapes	To address the decline in farmland birds across agricultural landscapes a key approach under agri-environment schemes has been the widespread creation of perennial grass-only buffer strips along field boundaries. However, despite a high dependency on these strips to enhance biodiversity in agricultural landscapes, it appears that benefits for farmland birds during the breeding season have been limited. We investigated the provision of plant and invertebrate resources for farmland birds in buffer strips that were established with three different seed mixes, including the standard grass-only habitat. We hypothesised that resource provision would differ between seed mix types due to differences in original composition. We also investigated three different types of management aimed at influencing sward composition and habitat structure, namely cutting, scarification and the application of graminicide. These approaches were used to influence the accessibility of structurally complex swards to farmland birds. We hypothesised that the abundance of plant and invertebrate resources and access to these resources would be directly related to management type. The abundance of plant resources and sward structure were determined using quadrats and the drop disc method respectively, whilst the invertebrates were assessed using suction sampling. The study demonstrated the value of including forbs (herbaceous plant species) in seed mixes used to establish buffer strips by increasing plant resources for farmland birds, although this was not coupled with an increase in beetle abundance and mass. However, grass-only buffer strips managed with annual cutting were shown to provide similar levels of invertebrate resources to farmland birds as with the more complex seed mixes, but it is likely that access to these resources was restricted by tall homogenous swards and a limited amount of bare ground. The study demonstrated that novel buffer strip management techniques can strongly influence both the resource abundance and resource access by farmland birds. Scarification in particular was shown to be highly effective at opening up the sward to increase access by farmland birds, but was associated with a reduction in plant resources. Given the financial barriers for the use of seed mixes that contain forbs to establish buffer strips, importantly the study has shown that the value of existing grass-only buffer strips for farmland birds can be enhanced through the use of scarification. Consequently, as an alternative to annual cutting, we recommend that scarification is periodically applied to narrow (1-3 m) strips next to the crop edge to enhance the value of grass-only buffer strips for farmland birds.
The Impact of the Refugee Experience on Children's Development	This is the second in a series of editorials written by Janet Harvell and Alison Prowle from the Centre for Early Childhood, University of Worcester, UK, on their experiences in the Dunkirk Refugee Camp in France. Here they draw out the challenges facing parents, professionals and volunteers in providing a physical, emotional and learning environment appropriate for the healthy development of very young children.

[pain]Byte VR Storytelling & Classical Ballet	This initial stage paper focuses on the Virtual Reality (VR) experience of the [pain]Byte ballet. The live and VR experience debut October 1st 2017, as part of the Brighton digital festival. Specifically, the development of the VR environment to compliment live performance by using the same choreography to create an option capture element of the VR story telling experience. Reviewing Virtual & Alternative reality gaming & storytelling works and the use of VR for chronic pain management (Chen, Win). Does the VR experience compare to that of the live theatre for the audience?    The data visualisations and VR environment will be continuations of the Network Simulator, [data]Storm 2015. We are visualising and comparing the pain pathway system to that of a social network. Linking pain signals to viral/negative messaging for some of the visuals. The main purpose of the pieces links to how “we" present ourselves online, these better or veiled versions of ourselves. For chronic pain sufferers, this can be daily activity in the real world. The paper concludes by identifying some future directions for the research project.    The Ballet: [pain]Byte is a data driven dance classical ballet performance and VR (virtual reality) experience. [pain]Byte, is about chronic pain and biomedical engineering, in particular the use of implanted technology - neuromodulation (Al-Kaisey et al). Using data as a medium for storytelling, what it means to be in chronic pain. The live augmented theatre and VR experience research focuses on how an audience’s exposure and understanding are impacted by the difference mediums used for [pain]byte.
Eye Movement Desensitisation and Reprocessing Therapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder in a Child and an Adolescent with Mild to Borderline Intellectual Disability: A Multiple Baseline Across Subjects Study	Background: This study explored the effectiveness of eye movement desensitisation and reprocessing (EMDR) therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in persons with mild to borderline intellectual disability (MBID) using a multiple baseline across subjects design. Methods: One child and one adolescent with MBID, who met diagnostic criteria for PTSD according to a PTSD clinical interview (i.e., ADIS-C PTSD section), adapted and validated for this target group, were offered four sessions of EMDR. PTSD symptoms were measured before, during and after EMDR, and at six weeks follow-up. Results: For both participants, number of PTSD symptoms decreased in response to treatment and both no longer met PTSD criteria at post-treatment. This result was maintained at 6-week follow-up. Conclusions: The results of this study add further support to the notion that EMDR can be an effective treatment for PTSD in children and adolescents with MBID. Replication of this study in larger samples and using a randomized controlled design is warranted. Â© 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd
The Type of Behavior and the Role of Relationship Length in Mate Choice for Prosociality Among Physically Attractive Individuals	Two further key aspects of prosociality as a sexual signal are explored here. Firstly, the context in which it is used (in particular relationship length), and, second, also the different types of prosocial behaviors that exist in social interactions. Therefore, this commentary can show why prosocial behaviors are biased towards physically attractive individuals, as they can gain valuable information from them.
A Community Hub Approach to Older People’s Housing	Purpose. This paper explores the potential of housing with care schemes to act as community hubs. The analysis highlights a range of benefits, barriers and facilitators.   Design/methodology/approach. Data is presented from the ASSET project (Adult Social Services Environments and Settings) which used a mixed methods approach including a review of the literature, surveys and in-depth case study interviews.   Findings. Most housing with care schemes have a restaurant or café, communal lounge, garden, hairdresser, activity room and laundrette, while many also have a library, gym, computer access and a shop. Many of these facilities are open not just to residents but also to the wider community, reflecting a more integrated approach to community health and adult social care, by sharing access to primary health care and social services between people living in the scheme and those living nearby. Potential benefits of this approach include the integration of older people’s housing, reduced isolation and increased cost effectiveness of local services through economies of scale and by maximising preventative approaches to health and wellbeing. Successful implementation of the model depends on a range of criteria including being located within or close to a residential area and having on-site facilities that are accessible to the public.   Originality and Value. This paper is part of a very new literature on community hub models of housing with care in the UK. In the light of new requirements under the Care Act to better coordinate community services, it provides insights into how this approach can work and offers an analysis of the benefits and challenges that will be of interest to commissioners and providers as well as planners. This was a small scale research project based on four case studies. Caution should be taken when considering the findings in different settings.
Seasonal Variation in Surface Soil Pollen Taxa Over 12 Months in Three English Mature Woodlands	This study aimed to determine whether or not a seasonal, or even monthly, pattern of pollen accumulation could be found in surface soil. Three mature woodlands in the English Midlands were selected and soil samples were taken from the same area, each month, for 12 months. Pollen types were recorded and compared across the woodlands. Pollen condition was assessed for seasonal differences in Bannam’s woodland. Two of the woodlands (Windmill Naps and Wirehill) had pollen assemblages that were dominated heavily by Quercus pollen but the third (Bannam’s) was more balanced. Each pollen type found was present in almost every month and winter was, for some types, a time of increased pollen. No clear, consistent patterns were visible in the results across the woodlands or for each pollen type. Although some pollen types showed an increase in levels during their flowering season, this was only consistent across all three woodlands for grasses (Poaceae). The condition of the pollen grains remained similar across the 12 months with a small (up to 12%) increase in fresh pollen in May. This study concludes that for damp woodland soil in the English Midlands, a clear, seasonal or monthly pattern cannot be determined.
Hamlet from the Bloc: 1990 and 2010	The Romanian Bulandra Theatre’s Hamlet visit to London, in 1990, was a much awaited event—by the critics, the diaspora and the wider British public. It finally talked to the world  about the long history of communist repression, fear and dissidence and about the recent bloody overthrow of the infamous Ceauşescus only months after the fall of the Berlin Wall. As lead actor Ion Caramitru declared when talking about the production’s run in mid-1980s Romania, “we were doing more than staging a production of Hamlet, we were preserving  the conscience of our people” (The Standard, 9 August 1990). While perceived to have lost its immediacy at home, only while touring abroad could this production, which opened in  1985 (after three years of battling with the censors), perform its scripted task: “to hold the mirror up to [present] nature” (3.2.20)1 anew. In London in 1990, this “new Prince from the  Bloc” did not portray “a mangled introvert but a vigorous, passionately committed” Hamlet; more importantly, he was a dissident in post-Revolution Romania: been and gone vicepresident, Ion Caramitru/Hamlet and this production in 1990 were warning about the “new dictatorship” in a “terrible vision of the future”—as Caramitru put it in his interview with  Robert Twedwr Moss (The Standard, 9 August 1990). This production’s vision, its lasting impact, its link with the London National Theatre and its former director Richard Eyre, all informed the production of Hamlet directed by Nicholas Hytner for the London NT in 2010. This article sets out to cross-examine what worked inside the Bloc in the mid-1980s but did no longer work on either side of the recently fallen Berlin Wall; equally, it examines the specific Eastern (European) tropes Hytner employed in 2010, in what appeared to be the first overtly political Hamlet for a decade in the UK. Finally, the paper aims to argue that by citing and sighting the Eastern Bloc as a trope, the 2010 UK production, too, by  “indirection directions found,” namely that Hamlet, “the play written about a surveillance state: a totalitarian monarchy with a high developed spy network”—as Hytner put it in an interview (Hamlet Programme)—was  critical(ly)  about  present  political  regimes  and agendas.
Commercialization Strategy in Managing Online Presence in the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Industry	Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as Drones, originally gained international prominence for warfare and surveillance.  Today, Drones are commercially made and distributed to the general public.   Academic researchers have studied the technical aspects of Drones. However, with the public interest and demands for Drones, there is a need to study commercialization of Drones, specifically management issues and strategies.  The purpose of this article is to shed some light on the commercialization of Drones by reviewing websites of companies that market Drones.  We identified four countries where businesses have been established to capitalize on the public demand for Drones.  We selected twenty-five companies in each of the four countries.  Each of the selected companies sponsored websites aimed at capitalizing on the potential Drone market.  We conducted a content analysis of each of the 100 company’s websites.   The results of our content analysis identified two significant variables that differentiate advanced, or nascent commercial endeavours from those companies making a “sort-of attempt” to get on the Drone bandwagon.  Our analysis identified two significant variables that distinguished the websites on mature Drone companies.  The two variables: attention to legal compliance; and insurance coverage.   Our analysis of website data supports our conclusion that a Drone company website should effectively communicate their management position regarding two crucial issues: legal compliance and insurance coverage.
Evidence and Practical Wound Care - An All-inclusive Approach	The quest for evidence-based medicine leads one in search of best available evidence but what exactly is this? Convention guides us towards the putative gold standard of the randomised controlled trial (RCT) but this approach provides limited access to the gathering of evidence that is relevant to a ‘real world’ environment. Taking several examples from wound care including moist wound healing, negative pressure wound therapy and dressing wounds with gauze we show that if one takes biology into consideration, the “truth” becomes more relevant to everyday life. We suggest that solely relying on the RCT in the quest for truth is misguided and that the research community should embrace a circular model of evidence rather than a hierarchical one.
From Screening to Synthesis: Using NVivo to Enhance Transparency in Qualitative Evidence Synthesis	Aims and objectives  The aim of this qualitative evidence synthesis was to explore the experiences and perceptions of health care staff caring for people with dementia in the acute setting. This paper focuses on the methodological process of conducting framework synthesis using NVivo for each stage of the review: screening, data extraction, synthesis and critical appraisal.    Background  Qualitative evidence synthesis brings together many research findings in a meaningful way that can be used to guide practice and policy development. For this purpose, synthesis must be conducted in a comprehensive and rigorous way. There has been previous discussion on how using NVivo can assist in enhancing and illustrate the rigorous processes involved.    Design  Qualitative Framework Synthesis.    Methods  Twelve documents, or research reports, based on nine studies, were included for synthesis.    Conclusion  The benefits of using NVivo are outlined in terms of facilitating teams of researchers to systematically and rigorously synthesise findings. NVivo functions were used to conduct a sensitivity analysis. Some valuable lessons were learned and these are presented to assist and guide researchers who wish to use similar methods in future.
A Comparison of Stress Levels, Coping Styles and Psychological Morbidity Between Graduate-entry and Traditional Undergraduate Medical Students During the First 2 Years at a UK Medical School.	Background:  Stress levels and psychological morbidity are high among undergraduate medical students (UGs), but there is a lack of research into the psychological health of UK graduate-entry medical students (GEs). GEs are likely to experience different (perhaps more severe) stressors and to cope with stress differently. We compared stress levels, psychological morbidity and coping styles in GE versus UG medical students studying at the same UK medical school in the same academic year.  Method:  A cross-sectional self-rated questionnaire study of all first- and second-year GE and UG medical students. Perceived stress, psychological morbidity, recent adverse life events, stress-related personality traits and coping styles were assessed using standard questionnaires.  Results:  75% GEs and 46% UGs responded to the questionnaire. Both groups reported equally high levels, and similar profiles of, perceived stress and psychological morbidity. Levels of recent adverse life events and stress-related personality traits were similar in both groups. Compared to UGs, GEs were more likely to use active coping (p = 0.02) and positive reframing (p = 0.03), but were also more likely to use substances (alcohol and other drugs; p < 0.001) to help them cope. Unlike UGs, second-year GEs showed less perceived stress (p = 0.007) and psychological morbidity (p = 0.006) than first-year GEs although levels of both were still high.  Conclusion:  Our results show that both GE students and their younger UG counterparts on a traditional medical course have similar profiles of stress symptoms. They do, however, cope with stress differently. GEs are more likely to use active problem-focused coping strategies, and they are also more likely to cope by using substances (alcohol or other drugs). GE students need interventions to prevent maladaptive coping styles and encourage adaptive coping that are tailored to their needs. Such interventions should be targeted at first-year students. It is vital that these students develop positive coping skills to benefit them during training and in a future career that is inherently stressful.
Determining the Efficacy of Interventions to Reduce Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) Perpetration by Men who Use Substances: a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis	A summary of key features from a systematic review protocol registered in PROSPERO International prospective register of systematic reviews.
Automatically Evolving Rotation-invariant Texture  Image Descriptors by Genetic Programming	In computer vision, training a model that performs classification effectively is highly dependent on the extracted features, and the number of training instances. Conventionally, feature detection and extraction are performed by a domain-expert who, in many cases, is expensive to employ and hard to find. Therefore, image descriptors have emerged to automate these tasks. However, designing an image descriptor still requires domain-expert intervention. Moreover, the majority of machine learning algorithms require a large number of training examples to perform well. However, labelled data is not always available or easy to acquire, and dealing with a large dataset can dramatically slow down the training process. In this paper, we propose a novel Genetic Programming based method that automatically synthesises a descriptor using only two training instances per class. The proposed method combines arithmetic operators to evolve a model that takes an image and generates a feature vector. The performance of the proposed method is assessed using six datasets for texture classification with different degrees of rotation, and is compared with seven domain-expert designed descriptors. The results show that the proposed method is robust to rotation, and has significantly outperformed, or achieved a comparable performance to, the baseline methods.
The Development of Environmental Assessment Tools to Support the Creation of Dementia Friendly Care Environments:  Innovative Practice	The need for more dementia friendly design in hospitals and other care settings is now widely acknowledged. Working with 26 NHS Trusts in England as part of a Department of Health commissioned programme, The King’s Fund developed a set of overarching design principles and an environmental assessment tool for hospital wards in 2012. Following requests from other sectors, additional tools were developed for hospitals, care homes, health centres and  housing with care. The tools have proven to be effective in both disseminating the principles of dementia friendly design and in enabling the case to be made for improvements that have a positive effect on patient outcomes and staff morale. This paper reports on the development,use and review of the environmental assessment tools, including further work that is now being taken forward by The Association for Dementia Studies, University of Worcester.
Developing the Potential of Observation - Generating Ideas Using Video Data From a Nursery School: a Students as Academic Partners Project	This Students as Academic Partners (SAP) project aimed to explore the potential of a creative approach to reflection. Developing approaches to reflective practice is directly relevant for a wide range of professional occupations including school teachers, early years practitioners, lecturers within HE and also trainees. Individual reflections were produced by project participants based on several very short video clips of children in a nursery school. The reflections include speculative observations, explanations and use of theoretical perspectives linked to broader themes. The analysis was extended through a collaborative reflection on the combined individual reflections. The focus on broader themes within this particular project seeks to contribute to an encompassing discourse related to early years practice.
The First Year Experience of Occupational Therapy Students at an Australian Regional University: Promoting Student Retention and Developing a Regional and Remote Workforce	Abstract  Objective: Student retention at regional universities is  important in addressing regional and remote workforce  shortages. Students attending regional universities are  more likely to work in regional areas. First year experience  at university plays a key role in student retention.  This study aimed to explore factors influencing the first  year experience of occupational therapy students at a  regional Australian university.  Design: Surveys were administered to 58 second year  occupational therapy students in the first week of  second year. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics,  inferential statistics (Pearson χ2; Spearman rho)  and summarising descriptive responses.  Setting: An Australian regional university.  Participants: Second year undergraduate occupational  therapy students.  Main outcome measures: Factors influencing students’  decisions to study and continue studying occupational  therapy; factors enhancing first year experience of  university.  Results: Fifty-four students completed the survey  (93.1%). A quarter (25.9%) of students considered  leaving the course during the first year. The primary  influence for continuing was the teaching and learning  experience. Most valued supports were orientation week  (36.7%) and the first year coordinator (36.7%).  Conclusion: The importance of the first year experience  in retaining occupational therapy students is highlighted.  Engagement with other students and staff and academic support are important factors in facilitating  student retention. It is important to understand the  unique factors influencing students’ decisions, particularly  those from regional and remote areas, to enter and  continue in tertiary education to assist in implementing  supports and strategies to improve student retention.
Cardiovascular Function During Supine Rest in Endurance Trained Males with New Zealand Blackcurrant: A Dose-Response Study	Purpose Blackcurrant contains anthocyanins that could alter cardiovascular function and reduce cardiovascular disease risk. We examined dose responses of New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract on cardiovascular function during supine rest. Methods Fifteen endurance trained male cyclists (age: 38±12 years, height: 178±5 cm, body mass: 76±10 kg, V?O2max: 56±8 mL?kg-1?min-1, mean±SD) were randomly assigned using a counterbalanced Latin square design to complete four conditions, a control of no NZBC, or one of three doses (300, 600 or 900 mg?day-1) of NZBC extract (CurraNZTM) for seven-days with a fourteen-day washout. Cardiovascular function (i.e. blood pressure, heart rate, ejection time, cardiac output, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance) during supine rest was examined (Portapres® Model 2). Results Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and ejection time were unchanged by NZBC. A dose effect (P<0.05) was observed for cardiac output, stroke volume and total peripheral resistance. A trend for a dose effect was observed for mean arterial blood pressure. Cardiac output increased by 0.6±0.6 L·min-1 (15%) and 1.0±1.0 L·min-1 (28%) and stroke volume by 5±8 mL (7%) and 6±17 mL (18%) between control and 600, and 900 mg?day-1, respectively. Total peripheral resistance decreased by 4±3 mmHg·L-1·min-1 (20%) and 5±9 mmHg·L-1·min-1 (20%) for 600, and 900 mg?day-1. Conclusion Seven-days intake of New Zealand blackcurrant extract demonstrated dose-dependent changes on some cardiovascular parameters during supine rest in endurance-trained male cyclists.
Technology Enhanced Learning in Psychology: Current Direction and Perspectives	Contemporary use of digital technologies has rapidly transformed the learning and teaching environment within higher education (Beetham and White, 2013; Jordan, 2013). When used effectively, technology can improve the usefulness and quality of feedback to support learning and create unique opportunities for active, independent learning (Trapp et al., 2011; Higher Education Academy, 2012; UoW, 2015). However, identifying appropriate technology and effectively embedding this within teaching practices can be challenging. Here we outline the way in which Psychology staff at the University of Worcester have used technology to enhance the student learning experience in four key areas: promoting engagement in large groups, enhancing participation in research, teaching via blended learning and fostering a learning community. We hope that sharing our experiences will be of value to colleagues interested in using technology for similar purposes.
Challenging Assumptions About Values, Interests and Power in Further and Higher Education Partnerships	This article raises questions that challenge assumptions about values, interests and power in further and higher education partnerships. These topics were explored in a series of semi-structured interviews with a sample of Principals and senior higher education partnership managers of colleges spread across a single region in England. The data suggest that common assumptions evident in the literature and professional discourse about the hegemony of higher education institutions in partnerships with further education and sixth form colleges may be misplaced. Questions are also raised about an exclusive focus upon shared values in educational partnerships, and it is suggested that greater clarity about the focus of educational partnerships can explain how successful partnerships can negotiate which values and interests are shared and which are not – an approach that can be a useful modus operandi in the increasingly competitive educational markets in which universities and colleges operate.
The Use of Mobile Technology in Lectures: Using an Audience Response System (Padlet) to Enhance the Student Learning Experience	This paper explores the usefulness of mobile technologies in the classroom, focusing on the Audience Response System of Padlet used during a specific module. Questionnaires (with both closed and open ended questions) were used to research how students engaged with this technology, particularly whether it encouraged greater participation as well as deep learning. Overall, the students had positive responses to Padlet as highlighted by the statistical findings. The comments in the open ended sections, though, noted that there are some issues with using such technology in classrooms. Importantly, it is worth noting that the technology should be embedded into the sessions within a variety of different methods in order to encourage deep learning.
Recognition and Belonging: Engaging First Generation Students	This paper is based on a reflective journey taken by project members which offers insight into the unique challenges that first generation students face and considers the institutional responses needed to enhance their engagement and experience. The student as academic partner’s project was developed to further explore issues of recognition, belonging and engagement for first generation students - who are the first in their families to attend higher education. Whilst this group of students should be celebrated as pioneers of higher education they are more likely than their counterparts to drop out of their studies or have a difficult transition to higher education because they lack the required social capital. In the face of widening participation and increasing access to university for students from diverse backgrounds the paper will consider the tension between the need for students to adapt in order to fit the university and the university’s need to adapt in order to fit the students. We will highlight small developments that can have the largest impact on both the university and the student population. Through this research, we believe that being a first generation student is not a barrier but a real and ongoing achievement!
Fine Art and Dementia: Looking at Paintings and Assessment for People with Dementia	This article describes an innovative teaching session designed and implemented at the University of Worcester, on the Foundation Degree in Dementia Studies. The class utilised teaching from art that was not linked in any way to the dementia context to promote learning for the students in a clinical aspect of their studies, that is assessment of need. Students reported that the approach enabled them to reflect upon their learning and engaged them in original learning, specifically new ways of thinking about aspects of their clinical practice. Additionally, new insight was provided into the value artworks may have as ‘creaturely objects’: as companions we have in our lives in a similar way to having animal or human companions. The article suggests that this pedagogic technique has wider implications; the approach of using fine art could be employed within a range of academic disciplines to encourage reflection upon learning and generate new insights.
Students Enhancing Their Learning Experience: From Evaluation to Action	Much of the formal module evaluation takes place at the end of a module through questionnaires developed by higher education institutions (HEIs) as part of their effort to improve modules. However, there is limited literature on approaches to module evaluation in collaboration with students. This deficiency in the literature represents an opportunity to involve students in the formative and summative evaluation of the module in order for them to enhance their learning experience from module evaluation to module improvement. This Student as Academic Partner (SAP) project focuses on an undergraduate module enhancement in terms of learning, teaching and assessment for the benefit of current and future students.
Aerosol-Radiation Feedback and PM10 Air Concentrations Over Poland	We have implemented the WRF-Chem model version 3.5 over Poland to quantify the direct and indirect feedback effects of aerosols on simulated meteorology and aerosol concentrations. Observations were compared with results from three simulations at high spatial resolutions of 5 × 5 km: (1) BASE—without any aerosol feedback effects; (2) DIR—with direct aerosol-radiative effects (3) INDIR—with direct and indirect aerosol-radiative effects. We study the overall effect during January 2011 as well as selected episodes of the highest differences in PM10 concentrations between the three simulations. For the DIR simulation, the decrease in monthly mean incoming solar radiation (SWDOWN) appears for the entire study area. It changes geographically, from about −8.0 to −2.0 W m−2, respectively for the southern and northern parts of the country. The highest changes do not correspond to the highest PM10 concentration. Due to the solar radiation changes, the surface mean monthly temperature (T2) decreases for 96 % of the area of Poland, but not more than 1.0 °C. Monthly mean PBLH changes by more than ±5 m for 53 % of the domain. Locally the differences in PBLH between the DIR and BASE are higher than ± 20 m. Due to the direct effect, for 84 % of the domain, the mean monthly PM10 concentrations increase by up to 1.9 µg m−3. For the INDIR simulation the spatial distribution of changes in incoming solar radiation as well as air temperature is similar to the DIR simulation. The decrease of SWDOWN is noticed for the entire domain and for 23 % of the domain is higher than −5.0 W m−2. The absolute differences of PBLH are slightly higher for INDIR than DIR but similarly distributed spatially. For daily episodes, the differences between the simulations are higher, both for meteorology and PM10 concentrations, and the pattern of changes is usually more complex. The results indicate the potential importance of the aerosol feedback effects on modelled meteorology and PM10 concentrations.
Alcohol Use, Alcohol-related Aggression and Intimate Partner Abuse: A Cross-sectional Survey of Convicted Versus General Population Men in Scotland	Introduction and Aims. Scotland has a particular problem with alcohol, and the links between intimate partner abuse (IPA)  and alcohol appear stronger here than elsewhere across Europe. This study explored differences in alcohol use, related aggression and  relationship conflict across a number of groups: men convicted for intimate partner abuse, men convicted of general offences and men  recruited from community sports teams. Design and Methods. Participants (n = 64) completed three questionnaires exploring  their experiences of alcohol use (Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test, AUDIT); alcohol and aggression (Alcohol Related  Aggression Questionnaire, ARAQ-28), and relationship conflict (Revised Conflict Tactics Scale, CTS-2). Results. There were  significant differences across the groups in terms of AUDIT and ARAQ-28 scores, IPA and general offenders scored higher than  the community sample. CTS-2 scores showed significant differences: both offender groups reported more use of negotiation and  psychological abuse, than the community men, and IPA offenders reported causing more physical harm than either general offenders  or the community sample. ARAQ-28 scores correlated with psychological abuse for general offenders. Alcohol use was  very high across all groups, but the community group did not endorse an aggression-precipitating view of alcohol and did not  report high IPA. Discussion and Conclusions. Discussed is the need for cross-cultural research to explore putative mediators  and moderators in the relationship between alcohol, aggressiveness and IPA. [Gilchrist EA, Ireland L, Forsyth A, Godwin J,  Laxton T.

Evidence For Genetic Heterogeneity Between Clinical Subtypes of Bipolar Disorder	We performed a genome-wide association study of 6447 bipolar disorder (BD) cases and 12 639 controls from the International Cohort Collection for Bipolar Disorder (ICCBD). Meta-analysis was performed with prior results from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Bipolar Group for a combined sample of 13 902 cases and 19 279 controls. We identified eight genome-wide  significant, associated regions, including a novel associated region on chromosome 10 (rs10884920; P = 3.28 × 10 − 8) that includes the brain-enriched cytoskeleton protein adducin 3 (ADD3), a non-coding RNA, and a neuropeptide-specific aminopeptidase P  (XPNPEP1). Our large sample size allowed us to test the heritability and genetic correlation of BD subtypes and investigate their genetic overlap with schizophrenia (SCZ) and major depressive disorder. We found a significant difference in heritability of the two  most common forms of BD (BD I h2 = 0.35; BD II h2 = 0.25; P = 0.02) with a genetic correlation between BD I and BD II of 0.78,compared with a genetic correlation of 0.97 when BD cohorts containing both types were compared. In addition, we demonstrated a significantly greater load of polygenic risk alleles for SCZ and BD in patients with BD I compared with patients with BD II, and a  greater load of SCZ risk alleles in the bipolar type of schizoaffective disorder (SAB) compared with both other BD subtypes. These results point to a partial difference in genetic architecture of BD subtypes, and are suggestive of a molecular correlate for the  clinical division of BD into subtypes.
Birmingham Rep, Youth and Community, and the Products and Possibilities of Precarity	Birmingham Rep, a leading producing theatre based in the UK’s  ‘second city’, has historically had a complex relationship with the cultural priorities of its home city. In recent years, Birmingham City  Council  has  faced  multiple  challenges  represented  by  debt  15 burden,  government-imposed  cuts  in  public  funding,  scandals  linked to failing children’s services and fears of Islamic radicalisation in the city’s schools. From a detailed consideration  of the way the Rep’s artistic policy has been shaped in  the context of chronic financial instability and these broader challenges, I argue that the increasingly central position youth  20 and community engagement has assumed signals a major paradigm shift in the expectations associated with the role and function of the regional producing theatre in the UK.
Introduction to the Special Issue on ‘Learning for Work’	The relationship between learning and work has a history that is long, complex and contested. The very title of this special issue, ‘Learning for Work’ is perhaps provocative, since many would challenge the idea implicit in that title that learning is or should be instrumental in preparation for work, developing skills in work, or meeting the needs of the economy, arguing that education is a citizen’s right in and of itself without reference to work or economic productivity. That is a big debate, and there is a wide array of theoretical and policy literature that defends both sides of the argument. This collection of articles represents a range of positions on the challenges and benefits of learning for work. These could have been revised and edited with a view to fitting them into a pre-conceived model or pattern of learning for work. However that would have imposed an artificial conceptual template on a field that is extremely rich and diverse. Rather, the collection seeks to showcase high quality research in the field of education related to preparation for work or enhancing employees’ knowledge and skills, to suggest how learning for work has been interpreted and implemented across a variety of settings.
Autistic and Schizotypal Traits and Global Functioning in Bipolar I Disorder	Objective: To determine the expression of autistic and positive schizotypal traits in a large sample of adults with bipolar I disorder (BD-I), and the effect of co-occurring autistic and positive schizotypal traits on global functioning in BD-I.   Method: Autistic and positive schizotypal traits were self-assessed in 797 individuals with BD-I recruited by the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Differences in global functioning (rated using the Global Assessment Scale) during lifetime worst depressive and manic episodes (GASD and GASM respectively) were calculated in groups with high/low autistic and positive schizotypal traits. Regression analyses assessed the interactive effect of autistic and positive schizotypal traits on global functioning.   Results: 47.2% (CI=43.7-50.7%) showed clinically significant levels of autistic traits, and 23.22% (95% CI=20.29-26.14) showed clinically significant levels of positive schizotypal traits. In the worst episode of mania, the high autistic, high positive schizotypal group had better global functioning compared to the other groups. Individual differences analyses showed that high levels of co-occurring traits were associated with better global functioning in both mood states.   Limitations: Autistic and schizotypal traits were assessed using self-rated questionnaires.   Conclusions: Expression of autistic and schizotypal traits in adults with BD-I is prevalent, and may be important to predict illness aetiology, prognosis, and diagnostic practices in this population. Future work should focus on replicating these findings in independent samples, and on the biological and/or psychosocial mechanisms underlying better global functioning in those who have high levels of both autistic and positive schizotypal traits.
Wing Chun Kuen: A Revised Historical Perspective (Part 2: Red Junks, Pirates and Secret Societies)	In the previous article, the Wing Chun ‘myth’ was dismissed due to the lack of supporting evidence for the existence of the Southern Shaolin Monastery. It would appear that the Southern Shaolin Monastery and the subsequent account of its destruction was based on the verified Northern Shaolin Monastery.    In this article, an alternate historical account for the development of Wing Chun is provided, where fiction becomes fact. This is achieved through analysing how and why Wing Chun developed within a travelling Cantonese Opera Company during a turbulent time of China’s history, where piracy and political violence were prevalent.
Exploring the Trajectory of Personal, Moral and Spiritual Values of 16- to 18-year-old Students Taking Religious Studies at A Level in the UK	This  study  set  out  to  explore  the  trajectory  of  personal,  moral  and  spiritual values of students taking Religious Studies at A level in the   UK.  A  sample  of  150  students  completed  a  battery  of  measures  at  the beginning of their period of A level study and again at the end. The data found no difference over this period of time in personal values (purpose  in  life,  self-esteem,  and  empathy)  in  some  moral  values  (concerning anti-social behaviour and concerning substance use) and in levels of religious exclusivism or frequency of private prayer. The areas in which significant differences were observed were concerned with attitude toward sex and relationships, religious pluralism, belief   in life after death, and mystical orientation. Between the ages of 16 and 18 years, following two years’ engagement with Religious Studies at  A  level,  the  participants  became  more  liberal  in  their  approach  toward sex and relationships, less convinced about the truth claims   of  religious  pluralism,  less  likely  to  adhere  to  traditional  Christian  teaching  on  life  after  death,  and  less  open  to  mystical  experience.    They are also less certain of ever having had a religious experience, and less frequent in their practice of religious attendance.
Not Re-inventing the Wheel: the Adaptive Implementation of the Meeting Centres Support Programme in Four European Countries	Objectives: The implementation of new health services is a complex process. This study investigated  the first phase of the adaptive implementation of the Dutch Meeting Centres Support Programme  (MCSP) for people with dementia and their carers in three European countries (Italy, Poland, the UK)  within the JPND-MEETINGDEM project. Anticipated and experienced factors influencing the  implementation, and the efficacy of the implementation process, were investigated. Findings were  compared with previous research in the Netherlands.  Method: A qualitative multiple case study design was applied. Checklist on anticipated facilitators and  barriers to the implementation and semi-structured interview were completed by stakeholders,  respectively at the end and at the beginning of the preparation phase.  Results: Overall, few differences between countries were founded. Facilitators for all countries were:  added value of MCSP matching needs of the target group, evidence of effectiveness of MCSP,  enthusiasm of stakeholders. General barriers were: competition with existing care and welfare  organizations and scarce funding. Some countries experienced improved collaborations, others had  difficulties finding a socially integrated location for MCSP. The step-by-step implementation method  proved efficacious.  Conclusion: These insights into factors influencing the implementation of MCSP in three European  countries and the efficacy of the step-by-step preparation may aid further implementation of MCSP in Europe
Challenges of Parenting in a Refugee Camp	Alison Prowle and Janet Harvell   from the Centre for Early   Childhood, University   of Worcester, UK, draw on their own experience of working at   the Dunkirk refugee   camp to describe the challenges   parents face.
Collaborative Evaluation of Individual and Team Performance in Training and Match Environments using the Coach Logic Online Platform	Sports coaches’ commonly have a limited appreciation of pedagogy (Light & Evans, 2013).  Furthermore, investigations concerning coaches’ use of performance analysis for athlete learning are rare (Groom, Cushion, & Nelson, 2011).  Complex Learning Theory (CLT) advocates nonlinear and sociocultural educative approaches (Light, 2013).  Considering this digital age, the aim of this investigation was to examine coaches’ use of Coach Logic - an online video-based coaching platform.  Seven Head Coaches (five rugby union and two field hockey) were interviewed individually whilst their coaching staff and players contributed to group interviews.  Results confirmed a priori themes of active, social and interpretive as derived from CLT.  Analysis of these findings established that online coaching platforms have the capacity to facilitate the active involvement of athletes in the process of performance analysis.  From a social perspective, online coaching platforms have helped to develop a positive team environment and also interpersonal working.  Good practice was evident relating to interpretive approaches; however, the potential for coaches to embrace more radical conceptualisations of knowledge acquisition is stark.  Online coaching platforms have a place in contemporary team sport environments and can contribute to athlete learning and other important aspects of team culture and cohesion.
Trapped Deep Beneath the Sewage: Representation of the University in Popular Music	This article reviews the lyrics of popular music in order to uncover how the ‘university’ is represented in this art form. The lyrics that feature university are coded into themes and these are discussed. The lyrics are initially coded to negative/positive/neutral, but group of more refined themes is also presented. The analysis reveals that whilst the university is still seen as a place of learning, the lyrics of these songs tend to present and represent the university in a negative light. The intention of this article is to promote debate into the way that the university is perceived by popular music songwriters, but also to demonstrate the importance of assessing the place of the university from outside of the (at times) myopic lens of higher educational research.
Wing Chun Kuen: A Revised Historical Perspective (Part 1)	Wing Chun Kuen (Beautiful Springtime First), more commonly known simply as ‘Wing Chun’ has steadily gained international recognition, originally due to the popularity of Bruce Lee, although more recently over the past decade with the films ‘Ip Man’, ‘Ip Man 2’, ‘Ip Man 3’, ‘The Legend is Born: Ip Man’ and ‘The Grandmaster’.    It is purported that Wing Chun was developed by a nun from the Southern Shaolin Monastey, Ng Mui, who progressed to teach Yim Wing Chun, from where the style received its name. Given that Wing Chun is a pragmatic combat system where speed and simultaneous attack and defence, adhering to principles of physics, the need for size, strength or flexibility is limited, a possible reason why the ‘myth’ that Wing Chun was developed by a woman has remained.    In this article, the myth of Ng Mui and the Southern Shaolin Monastery is questioned as a basis for providing an alternate historical argument and justification for the development of Wing Chun.
Reducing Mental Health Stigma - The Relationship Between Knowledge and Attitude Change	The impact of how knowledge can effect attitude change is important in order to understand the consequences for stigma. The relationship between increasing subject knowledge of mental health and attitude change was explored.  The sample comprised 39 students (18 male and 21 female) from a University in the West Midlands. Participant’s level of knowledge and stigma were recorded pre and post-test using the Mental Health Knowledge Schedule (MAKS), Community Attitudes toward the Mentally Ill (CAMI) and the Opinions about Mental Illness (OMI) scale. Information about mental illness was provided between conditions followed by a distractor task. Responses were calculated and combined to give an overall score. A sign test with continuity correction was used to see whether there was a difference in attitudes. The pre and post-test conditions were scored. Results demonstrate a statistically significant median decrease in stigma in the post-test condition (p = .03). Therefore, this research provides support for the success of providing knowledge and information about mental illness in order to reduce stigma.
The Theatricality of Objects: Object Theatre Beyond the Puppet	The term ‘object theatre’ emerges from the world of puppets. It describes a form of puppetry that utilises found, or real, objects in puppeteering, to create anthropomorphic characters or to symbolise figures, places, landscapes or metaphorical ideas. In this configuration, ‘objects’ become puppets. In this article, I want to suggest an expansion of the term ‘object theatre’ as a way of extending how theatre makers and audiences might speculate on the activity and agency of objects beyond this particular mode of representation.
Theatrical Latency: Walking Katrina Palmer’s The Loss Adjusters	In this article I introduce the term ‘theatrical latency’ as a pleasurable effect experienced when listening to sound in relation to visual perception. Latency refers to both the phenomena of audio delay (in feedback from analogue to digital conversion and the momentary lapses experienced when playing live with recorded music) and a theatrical sensation that comes from the reanimation of visual environments through aural framing. In this configuration, the notion of latency takes on a double meaning as both a recorded phenomenon and the retrieval of something dormant within physical objects, sites or materials. These ideas will be introduced through my experience of walking Katrina Palmer’s site-specific audio work The Loss Adjusters (2015) on the island of Portland (UK). The audio tracks create an extended meditation on Portland, interweaving specific locations and histories with fictional characters and ghosts of the island.
The Use of the Term “DNA” as a Missiological Metaphor in Contemporary Church Narratives	Missiologists propose that the Church and mission are inseparable as the Church has its very  being because there is mission, and it is the Missio Dei which constitutes the Church. In recent  history the Anglican Church has interpreted this as the essential ‘DNA’ of the local church  which is to be a missional community. The church’s mission therefore is presented as the gift  of participating through the Holy Spirit in the Son’s mission from the Father to the world. In  other words, it is proposed that the Church is both the fruit of God’s mission and the agent of  His mission. But, in order to communicate this relationship between Church and mission in a  postmodern context, the use of new metaphors and new terminologies, which are derived  from our contemporary context, is shaping new ways of thinking. An exploration of the  development of missional churches considers the significance of developing and embedding  what has become referred to as missional DNA or mDNA at every level of the organisation of  the Church. This mDNA is the outward model of missional behaviour that compels the whole  church to reach a lost world. It can be seen from evidence-based, case study research amongst  large churches in the UK that there is consistency in the adoption and use of the term DNA by  its leadership in reference to the local church’s values and its attitude towards mission. This  article explores the hypothesis that the term DNA is commonly accepted amongst local  churches as a contributor to a contemporary language that forms the narrative of the Church  and explores its feasibility and shortcomings as an adopted missiological metaphor.
Concerns and Expectations of Students Participating in Study Abroad Programs: Blogging to Reveal the Dynamic Student Voice	Study abroad programmes (SAP) have become increasingly popular with university students and within academia. They are often seen as an experiential opportunity to expand student learning and development, including increases in global, international, and intercultural competences. However, despite the increasing popularity of and participation in study abroad programmes, many student concerns and uncertainties remain. This research investigates initial pre-departure concerns and apprehensions of students undertaking a one-semester study abroad programme and uses these as context for an examination of violated expectations of students during their programme. The research uses interpretative phenomenological analysis to interpret data collected from regularly-updated blogs composed by students throughout their SAP experience. The process of using blogs to collect data is less formalised than many other approaches of interpretative phenomenological analysis, enabling ‘in the moment’ feedback during the SAP and lending greater depth to the understanding of student perceptions.
Tropes and Trench Cakes: The Home Front in the Media and Community History	The recent WW1 'fest' has provided a multitude of different engagements with the history of this conflict by media and community groups. The relationship between these histories and academic history is not unproblematic. It provides space for a greater emphasis on the home front but there are questions to be asked about the politics and the accuracy of such history. It is up to academics to find ways of working with popular histories which ensure that troublesome knowledge of the conflict continues to be explored.
Survivorship and Clinical Outcome of the Minimally Invasive Uniglide Medial Fixed Bearing, All-polyethylene Tibia, Unicompartmental Knee Arthroplasty at a Mean Follow-up of 7.3 Years	Background: Medial UKA performed in England and Wales represents 7 to 11% of all knee arthroplasty procedures, and is most commonly performed using mobile-bearing designs.   Fixed bearing eliminates the risk of bearing dislocation, however some studies have shown higher revision rates for all-polyethylene tibial components compared to those that utilize metal-backed implants. The aim of the study is to analyse survivorship and maximum 8-year clinical outcome of medial fixed bearing, Uniglide unicompartmental knee arthroplasty performed using an all-polyethylene tibial component with a minimal invasive approach.    Methods: Between 2002 and 2009, 270 medial fixed UKAs were performed in our unit. Patients were reviewed pre-operatively, 5 and 8 years post-operatively. Clinical and radiographic reviews were carried out. Patients’ outcome scores (Oxford, WOMAC and American Knee Score) were documented in our database and analysed.    Results: Survival and clinical outcome data of 236 knees with a mean 7.3 years follow-up are reported. Every patient with less than 4.93 years follow-up underwent a revision. The patients’ average age at the time of surgery was 69.5 years. The American Knee Society Pain and Function scores, the Oxford Knee Score and the WOMAC score all improved significantly. The 5 years survival rate was 94.1% with implant revision surgery as an end point. The estimated 10 years survival rate is 91.3%. 14 patients were revised before the 5 year follow-up.    Conclusion: Fixed bearing Uniglide UKA with an all-polyethylene tibial component is a valuable tool in the management of a medial compartment osteoarthritis, affording good short term survivorship.
Pollen Nightmare: Elevated Airborne Pollen Levels at Night	High airborne pollen concentrations are generally associated with daylight hours when it is sunny and warm and plants release pollen into the air (Alcázar et al. 1999; Dahl et al. 2013). In contrast, cooler night-time periods are usually considered to be the time of low-allergy risk. This opinion is often reflected in pollen allergy avoidance strategies presented by the media, where the most commonly repeated recommendation is to stay indoors during the day and plan outdoor activities for the evening. However, there is evidence to suggest that elevated concentrations of airborne pollen might also occur during the evening (e.g. Norris-Hill and Emberlin 1991). So, is the night really a time of low-allergy risk? We present the results of the comparative analysis of pollen concentrations during daytime and night-time hours for five allergenic pollen types (Burbach et al. 2009), i.e. alder (Alnus sp.), birch (Betula sp.), grasses (Poaceae), mugwort (Artemisia sp.) and ragweed (Ambrosia sp.).
Linking Research and Teaching: an Applied Soft Systems Methodology Case Study	This paper links research and teaching through an applied Soft Systems Methodology case study.  The case study focuses on the redevelopment of a Research and Professional Skills module to provide support for international postgraduate students through the use of formative feedback with the aim of increasing academic research skills and confidence. The stages of the Soft Systems Methodology were used as a structure for the redevelopment of module content and assessment.  It proved to be a valuable tool for identifying complex issues, a basis for discussion and debate from which an enhanced understanding was gained and a successful solution implemented together with a case study that could be utilised for teaching Soft Systems Methodology concepts.  Changes to the module were very successful and resulted in significantly higher grades and a higher pass rate.
Comparisons of Fungal Spore Distributions Using Air Sampling at Worcester, England (2006-2010)	This study determined annual and monthly  fluctuations in concentration of 20 fungal genera. The  selection of taxa was made based upon their high  frequency in the air as well as their well-known  allergenic properties. Air samples were collected using  a spore trap of Hirst design at an urban site where the  trap continuously worked throughout a 5-year survey.  Weather data were acquired from a meteorological  station co-located with the air sampler. Influence of  several meteorological parameters was then examined  to reveal species–environment interactions and the  potential location of fungal spore sources within the  urban area. The maximum monthly sum of mean daily  spore concentration varied between genera, and the  earliest peaks were recorded for Pleospora sp. in April  and Ustilago sp. in June. However, the majority of  investigated spore types occurred in the greatest  concentrations between August and September. Out  of the 20 studied taxa, the most dominant genus was  Cladosporium sp., which exceeded an allergenic  threshold of 3000 s m-3 40 times during very rainy  years and twice as much during dry years. A Spearman’s  rank test showed that statistically significant  (p B 0.05) relationships between spore concentration  and weather parameters were mainly rs B 0.50. Potential  sources of spores at Worcester were likely to be  localised outside the city area.
Exercise Prescription for Patients with Non-specific Chronic Low Back Pain: a Qualitative Exploration of Decision Making in Physiotherapy Practice	Background: Providing an effective exercise prescription process for patients with non-specific chronic low back pain (NSCLBP) is a challenging task. Emerging research has indicated that partnership in care and shared decision making are important for people with NSCLBP and calls for further investigation into the approaches used to prescribe exercise. Objective: To explore how shared decision making and patient partnership are addressed by physiotherapists in the process of exercise prescription for patients with NSCLBP. Design: A qualitative study using a philosophical hermeneutic approach. Methods: Eight physiotherapists were each observed on three occasions undertaking their usual clinical activities (total n=24 observations). They conducted brief interviews after each observation and a later in depth semi-structured interview. Iterative hermeneutic strategies were used to interpret the texts and identify the characteristics and processes of exercise prescription for patients with NSCLBP. Findings: The findings revealed how physiotherapy practice often resulted in unequal possibilities for patient participation which were in turn linked to the physiotherapists? assumptions about the patients, clinical orientation, cognitive and decision making processes. Three linked themes emerged: (1) I want them to exercise, (2) Which exercise? - the tension between evidence and everyday practice and (3) Compliance-orientated more than concordance based. Conclusions: This research, by focusing on a patient-centred approach, makes an important contribution to the body of evidence relating to the management of NSCLBP. It challenges physiotherapists to critically appraise their approaches to the prescription of exercise therapy in order to improve outcomes for these patients.
Exercise Prescription for Patients with Non-specific Chronic Low Back Pain: a Qualitative Study of Patients' Experiences in Decision Making	Background The culture of current clinical practice calls for collaboration between therapists and patients, sharing power and responsibility. This paper reports on the findings of a qualitative study of exercise prescription for patients with NSCLBP, taking into account issues such as decision making and how this accords with patient preferences and experiences. Objective To understand the treatment decision making experiences, information and decision support needs of patients with NSCLBP who have been offered exercise as part of their management plan.  Design A qualitative study using a philosophical hermeneutic approach. Methods Semi-structured interviews with eight patients (including use of brief patient vignettes) was undertaken to explore their personal experiences of receiving exercise as part of the management of their NSCLBP, and their involvement in decisions regarding their care. Findings The findings provide a detailed insight into patients’ perceptions and experiences of receiving exercise-based management strategies. Four themes were formed from the texts: (1) patients’ expectations and patients’ needs are not synonymous, (2) information is necessary but often not sufficient, (3) not all decisions need to be shared, and (4) wanting to be treated as an individual. Conclusions Shared decision making did not appear to happen in physiotherapy clinical practice, but equally may not be what every patient wants. The overall feeling of the patients was that the therapist was dominant in structuring the interactions, leaving the patients feeling disempowered to question and contribute to the decision making.
The Long Distance Transport of Airborne Ambrosia Pollen to the UK and the Netherlands from Central and South Europe	Background: The invasive alien species Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common or short ragweed) is increasing its range in Europe. In the UK and the Netherlands airborne concentrations of Ambrosia pollen are usually low. However, more than 30 Ambrosia pollen grains per cubic metre of air (above the level capable to trigger allergic symptoms) were recorded in Leicester (UK) and Leiden (NL) on 4 and 5 September 2014.  Objective: The aims of this study were to determine whether the highly allergenic Ambrosia pollen recorded during the episode could be the result of long distance transport, to identify the potential sources of these pollen grains and describe the conditions that facilitated this possible long distance transport.  Methods: Airborne Ambrosia pollen data were collected at 10 sites in Europe. Back trajectory and atmospheric dispersion calculations were performed using HYSPLIT_4.  Results: Back trajectories calculated at Leicester and Leiden show that higher altitude air masses (1500m) originated from source areas on the Pannonian Plain and Ukraine. During the episode, air masses veered to the west and passed over the Rhône Valley. Dispersion calculations showed that the atmospheric conditions were suitable for  Ambrosia pollen released from the Pannonian Plain and the Rhône Valley to reach the higher levels and enter the air stream moving to Northwest Europe where they were  deposited at ground level and recorded by monitoring sites.  Conclusions: The study indicates that the Ambrosia pollen grains recorded during the episode in Leicester and Leiden were probably not produced by local sources, but transported long distances from potential source regions in East Europe, i.e. the Pannonian Plain and Ukraine, as well as the Rhône Valley in France.
Excavations at a Cropmark Henge near Bredon, Worcestershire	Excavations at a cropmark, suspected to be a henge, at Bredon, Worcestershire, confirmed the  status of the site and uncovered evidence for extensive reuse and remodelling in the Middle Bronze  Age. This included the recutting of the henge ditch, the construction of a palisade and deposition  of cremated human remains. The site was subsequently levelled, probably in the later Bronze Age/  earlier Iron Age. Evidence was also recovered for the early use of Malvernian clay as a source of  potting raw materials and Cornish gabbro tempered pottery was also identified.  This article places the reuse of the henge within its regional and national context and highlights  the evidence for similar activities at other henge sites during the Middle and Later Bronze Age. It  is suggested that this renewal of interest in old monuments was linked to the deposition of human  remains.
The Growth of Population in Victorian Colwall	This short article examines the increase in population in a Herefordshire parish between 1851 and 1901.  One major factor in this process appears to have been the influx of wealthy people (with large numbers of servants) seeking an attractive environment with easy access to Birmingham and London.
Airborne Quercus Pollen in SW Spain: Identifying Favourable Conditions for Atmospheric Transport and Potential Source Areas	The pollen grains of Quercus spp. (oak trees) are allergenic. This study investigates airborne Quercus pollen in SW Spain with the aim identifying favourable conditions for atmospheric transport and potential sources areas. Two types of Quercus distribution maps were produced. Airborne Quercus pollen concentrations were measured at three sites located in the Extremadura region (SW Spain) for 3 consecutive years. The seasonal occurrence of Quercus pollen in the air was investigated, as well as days with pollen concentrations ≥ 80 P m− 3. The distance that Quercus pollen can be transported in appreciable numbers was calculated using clusters of back trajectories representing the air mass movement above the source areas (oak woodlands), and by using a state-of-the-art dispersion model. The two main potential sources of Quercus airborne pollen captured in SW Spain are Q. ilex subsp. ballota and Q. suber. The minimum distances between aerobiological stations and Quercus woodlands have been estimated as: 40 km (Plasencia), 66 km (Don Benito), 62 km (Zafra) from the context of this study. Daily mean Quercus pollen concentration can exceed 1,700 P m− 3, levels reached not less than 24 days in a single year. High Quercus pollen concentration were mostly associated with moderate wind speed events (6–10 m s− 1), whereas that a high wind speed (16–20 m s− 1) seems to be associated with low concentrations.
Engaging Students, Shaping Services: The Changing Face of Student Engagement at The Hive	Library roles with a unique focus on student or customer engagement are relatively new in the sector and Worcester is one of the first universities to recruit to this area. Rather than focusing on the relationship between engagement and learning, this role seeks to engage with students as partners and agents for change who are actively involved in evaluating, developing and delivering our library service. This article outlines some of our initial successes and impacts, which are already changing the way we interact with our student population. It will also cover some of the challenges faced along the way, particularly in delivering service change in the context of the radical new service model of The Hive.
"SEN's Completely Different Now": Critical Discourse Analysis of Three "Codes of Practice for Special Educational Needs"	Regardless of the differing shades of neo-liberalism, successive governments have claimed to champion the cause of “special educational needs and/or disability” (SEND) through official Codes of Practice in 1994, 2001 and 2015. This analysis and comparison of the three Codes of Practice aims to contribute to the debate by exploring aspects of the documents themselves. Each Code of Practice aims,  or at least claims, to overcome past barriers and the 2015 version explicitly heralds a radical overhaul of the SEND system. In this article,elements of critical discourse analysis (CDA) are used in exploring the  three documents, with particular emphasis on the 2015 Code. The conclusion is reached that while the fundamental stance on SEND remains unchanged in 2015, radical change is present and is all the more radical for being hidden in plain sight, delivering commissioning and procurement and a potentially arms-length approach to provision. As an integral part of the overall school system, the 2015 context for SEND is one of school diversity and choice and the model is of private sector competition and entrepreneurship in a context of austerity.
From Management to Prevention: the New Cure for Sports Concussion	A case for directing attention away from concussion management and towards the prevention of concussions in sport.
Handling Ophelia: a Story in Four Unscripted Scenes	Referring to several European productions of Hamlet between 2001 and 2014, Nicoleta Cinpoeş in this article examines the stage struggle to ‘recuperate’ an Ophelia that both discursive criticism and visual objectification bury prematurely, albeit by different means and for different aims, when they claim, in Laertes's words: ‘The woman will be out.’ She takes Laertes's words to mean both taking the woman out and putting the woman on view, and offers a preliminary survey of the customary textual cuts and their effect on Ophelia's part, exploring ‘the four unscripted scenes’ of three directors – Vlad Mugur, Radu Alexandru Nica, and Jan Klata – and their impact on Ophelia's role as found in Shakespeare's play. Nicoleta Cinpoeş is Principal Lecturer at the University of Worcester and author of Shakespeare's Hamlet in Romania 1778–2008 (Mellen, 2010) as well as editor of, and contributor to, Doing Kyd (Manchester University Press, 2016). She has published articles in Shakespeare Bulletin, SEDERI, Testi e linguaggi, Arrêts sur scène, Theatrical Blends, and Studia Dramatica.
Understanding the Patient Experience Through the Power of Film: a Mixed Method Qualitative Research Study	Background  For decades film has proved to be a powerful form of communication. Whether produced as entertainment, art or documentary, films have the capacity to inform and move us. Films are a highly attractive teaching instrument and an appropriate teaching method in health education. It is a valuable tool for studying situations most transcendental to human beings such as pain, disease and death.    Objectives  The objectives were to determine how this helps students engage with their role as health care professionals; to determine how they view the personal experience of illness, disease, disability or death; and to determine how this may impact upon their provision of patient care.    Design, Setting and Participants  The project was underpinned by the film selection determined by considerate review, intensive scrutiny, contemplation and discourse by the research team. 7 films were selected, ranging from animation; foreign, documentary, biopic and Hollywood drama. Each film was shown discretely, in an acoustic lecture theatre projected onto a large screen to pre-registration student nurses (adult, child and mental health) across each year of study from different cohorts (n = 49).    Method  A mixed qualitative method approach consisted of audio-recorded 5-minute reactions post film screening; coded questionnaires; and focus group. Findings were drawn from the impact of the films through thematic analysis of data sets and subjective text condensation categorised as: new insights looking through patient eyes; evoking emotion in student nurses; spiritual care; going to the moves to learn about the patient experience; self discovery through films; using films to link theory to practice.    Results  Deeper learning through film as a powerful medium was identified in meeting the objectives of the study. Integration of film into pre registration curriculum, pedagogy, teaching and learning is recommended.    Conclusion  The teaching potential of film stems from the visual process linked to human emotion and experience. Its impact has the power to not only help in learning the values that underpin nursing, but also for respecting the patient experience of disease, disability, death and its reality.
Narrative Matters: ‘The third space’ in Adolescent and Young Adult Fiction	In his article ‘Narrative Matters’, Gordon Bates (Bates,  2016) discusses the relevance of the humanities, and in  particular that of ﬁction, in helping us to understand the  experiences and problems of adolescents suffering men-  tal health problems. Notably, the number of novels pub-  lished for children and adolescents that focus on mental  health problems has risen considerably since the begin-  ning of this century. The ‘Goodreads’ (Goodreads, 2016)  website lists more than 1000 ﬁction titles on matters  pertaining to mental illness published for the UK and US  markets since 2000.
Demand Forecasting and Capacity Management	The level of demand for healthcare services fluctuates widely, putting pressure on the healthcare capacity. This article examines some of the approaches available to healthcare services providers for forecasting future demand. Accurate forecasting of future demand enables healthcare services capacity to be adjusted so as to fit demand. The article also includes some discussion of how developing innovative capacity can serve to make some healthcare services more accessible.
Genetic Overlap Between Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder and Bipolar Disorder: Evidence From Genome-wide Association  Study Meta-analysis	ABSTRACT  BACKGROUND: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and bipolar disorder (BPD) are frequently cooccurring and highly heritable mental health conditions. We hypothesized that BPD cases with an early age ofonset (#21 years old) would be particularly likely to show genetic covariation with ADHD.  METHODS: Genome-wide association study data were available for 4609 individuals with ADHD, 9650 individuals with BPD (5167 thereof with early-onset BPD), and 21,363 typically developing controls. We conducted a cross disorder genome-wide association study meta-analysis to identify whether the observed comorbidity between ADHD and BPD could be due to shared genetic risks.  RESULTS: We found a significant single nucleotide polymorphism–based genetic correlation between ADHD and  BPD in the full and age-restricted samples (rGfull 5 .64, p 5 3.13 3 10–14; rGrestricted 5 .71, p 5 4.09 3 10–16). The  meta-analysis between the full BPD sample identified two genome-wide significant (prs7089973 5 2.47 3 10–8;  prs11756438 5 4.36 3 10–8) regions located on chromosomes 6 (CEP85L) and 10 (TAF9BP2). Restricting the analyses  to BPD cases with an early onset yielded one genome-wide significant association (prs58502974 5 2.11 3 10–8) on  chromosome 5 in the ADCY2 gene. Additional nominally significant regions identified contained known expression  quantitative trait loci with putative functional consequences for NT5DC1, NT5DC2, and CACNB3 expression,  whereas functional predictions implicated ABLIM1 as an allele-specific expressed gene in neuronal tissue.  CONCLUSIONS: The single nucleotide polymorphism–based genetic correlation between ADHD and BPD is  substantial, significant, and consistent with the existence of genetic overlap between ADHD and BPD, with potential differential genetic mechanisms involved in early and later BPD onset.
Replicating the Networking, Mentoring and Venture Creation Benefits of Entrepreneurship Centres on a Shoestring: A Student-centred Approach to Entrepreneurship Education and Venture Creation	As support for both university-level entrepreneurial education and the use of experiential learning methods to foster student entrepreneurs increases, so too have the number of university-established or affiliated entrepreneurship centers. The activity at the center of this study aimed to combine experiential learning methods with assets associated with entrepreneurship centers, including venture creation, networking, and mentoring. Students were invited to participate in a competition wherein they were guided through the business creation process and pitched their ideas to investor judges who chose the winner and provided capital start-up funding and consulting. This research puts forth that university faculty at institutions without entrepreneurship centers can organize experiences to provide the benefits of entrepreneurship centers. The study used interviews to find that many of the benefits of entrepreneurship centers were able to be replicated using this method. The project is outlined, outcomes are analyzed, and the results and lessons learned are discussed.
Impacts of Survival and Reproductive Success on the Long-term Population Viability of Reintroduced Great Bustards Otis Tarda in the UK	Reintroductions aim to re-establish species within  their historical ranges through the release of wild- or  captive-bred individuals following extirpation (or extinction) in the wild. There is no general agreement on what constitutes a successful reintroduction but the probability of the population achieving long-term persistence should be addressed. Here we review a 10-year trial reintroduction of the great bustard Otis tarda, a globally threatened bird species, to the UK and assess the long-term population viability. Despite changes in rearing and release strategy, initial post-release survival probability remained consistently low, with only 11.3% of bustards (n = 167) surviving from release to 1 year post-release. Nineteen breeding attempts were made by eight females; however, only one chick survived > 100 days after hatching, and no wild juveniles have recruited into the population. Using demographic rates from the UK population and wild populations elsewhere, and stochastic population modelling, we investigate the viability of this reintroduced population by predicting population size over the next 10 years. Under current demographic rates the population was predicted to decline rapidly. Self-sufficiency was predicted  only using the highest estimates from the UK population for first-year and adult survival, and recruitment rates from wild populations elsewhere. Although changes have been made in rearing, release strategies, habitat management and release sites used, these changes appear to have a modest effect on long-term viability. Substantial improvements in survival rates and productivity are necessary to establish a viable great bustard population in the UK, and we consider this unlikely.
Mesoscale Atmospheric Transport of Ragweed Pollen Allergens  from Infected to Uninfected Areas	Allergenic ragweed (Ambrosia spp.) pollen grains,  after being released from anthers, can be dispersed by air  masses far from their source. However, the action of air temperature,humidity and solar radiation on pollen grains in the atmosphere could impact on the ability of long distance transported (LDT) pollen to maintain allergenic potency. Here, we report that the major allergen of Ambrosia artemisiifolia pollen (Amb a 1) collected in ambient air during episodes of LDT still have immunoreactive properties. The amount of Amb a 1 found in LDT ragweed pollen grains was not constant and varied between episodes. In addition to allergens in pollen sized particles, we detected reactive Amb a 1 in subpollen sized respirable particles. These findings suggest that ragweed pollen grains have the potential to cause allergic reactions, not only in the heavily infested areas but, due to LDT episodes, also in the regions unaffected by ragweed populations.
A Parameter Estimation and Identifiability Analysis  Methodology Applied to a Street Canyon Air Pollution  Model	Mathematical models are increasingly used in environmental science thus increasing  the importance of uncertainty and sensitivity analyses. In the present  study, an iterative parameter estimation and identifiability analysis methodology  is applied to an atmospheric model – the Operational Street Pollution Model  (OSPMr). To assess the predictive validity of the model, the data is split into  an estimation and a prediction data set using two data splitting approaches and  data preparation techniques (clustering and outlier detection) are analysed. The  sensitivity analysis, being part of the identifiability analysis, showed that some  model parameters were significantly more sensitive than others. The application  of the determined optimal parameter values was shown to succesfully equilibrate  the model biases among the individual streets and species. It was as well shown  that the frequentist approach applied for the uncertainty calculations underestimated  the parameter uncertainties. The model parameter uncertainty was  qualitatively assessed to be significant, and reduction strategies were identified.
Development and Psychometric Evaluation of the Assessment of Core CBT Skills (ACCS): An Observation Based Tool for Assessing Cognitive Behavioural Therapy Competence	This paper outlines the development and psychometric evaluation of the Assessment of Core CBT Skills (ACCS) rating scale. The ACCS aims to provide a novel assessment framework to deliver formative and summative feedback regarding therapists’ performance within observed cognitive-behavioural treatment sessions, and for therapists to rate and reflect on their own performance. Findings from three studies are outlined: 1) a feedback study (N = 66) examining content validity, face validity and usability, 2) a focus group (N = 9) evaluating usability and utility, and 3) an evaluation of the psychometric properties of the ACCS in ‘real world’ CBT training and routine clinical practice contexts. Results suggest that the ACCS has good face validity, content validity, and usability and provides a user-friendly tool that is useful for promoting self-reflection and providing formative feedback. Scores on both the self and assessor-rated versions of the ACCS demonstrate good internal consistency, inter-rater reliability, and discriminant validity. In addition, ACCS scores were found to be correlated with, but distinct from the Revised Cognitive Therapy Scale (CTS-R) and were comparable to CTS-R scores in terms of internal consistency and discriminant validity. Additionally, the ACCS may have advantages over the CTS-R in terms of inter-rater reliability of scores. The studies also provided insight into areas for refinement and a number of modifications were undertaken to improve the scale. In summary, the ACCS is an appropriate and useful measure of CBT competence that can be used to promote self-reflection and provide therapists with formative and summative feedback.
The Metaethics of Nursing Codes of Ethics and Conduct	Nursing codes of ethics and conduct are features of professional practice across the world, and in the UK, the regulator has recently consulted on and published a new code. Initially part of a professionalising agenda, nursing codes have recently come to represent a managerialist and disciplinary agenda and nursing can no longer be regarded as a self-regulating profession.This paper argues that codes of ethics and codes of conduct are significantly different in form and function similar to the difference between ethics and law in everyday life. Some codes successfully integrate these two functions within the same document, while others, principally the UK Code, conflate them resulting in an ambiguous document unable to fulfil its functions effectively. The paper analyses the differences between ethical- codes and conduct-codes by discussing titles, authorship, level, scope for disagreement, consequences of transgression, language and finally and possibly most importantly agent-centeredness. It is argued that conduct codes cannot require nurses to be compassionate because compassion involves an emotional response. The concept of kindness provides a plausible alternative for conduct-codes as it is possible to understand it solely in terms of acts. But if kindness is required in conduct-codes, investigation and possible censure follows from its absence. Using examples it is argued that there are at last five possible accounts of the absence of kindness. As well as being potentially problematic for disciplinary panels, difficulty in understanding the features of blameworthy absence of kindness may challenge UK nurses who, following a recently introduced revalidation procedure, are required to reflect on their practice in relation to The Code. It is concluded that closer attention to metaethical concerns by code writers will better support the functions of their issuing organisations.
An Examination of Privacy Policies of Global On-line E-pharmacies	This paper investigates the differences in privacy policy functions among 90 online pharmacy websites in nine countries in Europe, Asia and North America. Results from this study show that the majority of websites do have privacy policies, but the level of functional protection of consumers varies widely. Even in those countries where strong privacy laws exist, the level of privacy protection adherence is often very low. Most studies of privacy policy issues have concentrated on websites from developed nations, with few studies of the pharmacy industry. A better understanding of this industry, as well as understanding the differences in privacy policy implementation among developing and developed countries, provides important lessons for both businesses and consumers.
Gaining by Giving? Peer Research into Service User and Carer Perceptions of Inclusivity in Higher Education	Service users and carers (SUAC) have made significant contributions to professional training in social work courses in Higher Education (HE) over the past decade in the UK.  Such participation has been championed by government, academics and SUAC groups from a range of theoretical and political perspectives. Most research into the effectiveness of SUAC involvement at HE has come from the perspectives of academics and very little SUAC-led research exists.  This qualitative peer research was led by two members of the University of Worcester’s SUAC group.  Findings were that SUAC perceived their involvement brought benefits to students, staff, the University and the local community.  Significant personal benefits such as finding a new support network, increased self-development and greater confidence to manage their own care were identified in ways that suggested that the benefits that can flow from SUAC involvement at HE are perhaps more far-reaching than previously recognised.  Barriers to inclusion were less than previously reported in the literature and the humanising effects of SUAC involvement are presented as a partial antidote to an increasingly marketised HE culture.
From Comics to Picturebooks: the Reading Moment as Focus for Devising Hybrid Narratives	This article presents findings from ongoing practitioner research that  looks closely at the relationship between comics and picturebooks as I  attempt to synthesise these forms in my work. I embarked on this study  as a visual storyteller working principally in comics, having found this  medium best suited to the kinds of narratives I wanted to make, and the  way that I wished to communicate them. One of the reasons for this is the dramatic, dialogic mode of the comic, which has no need of a  narrating text or ‘voice’ (though such a voice may also come into play).   The motivation for conducting this research was a wish to find ways  of making picturebooks where direct speech is viable as the only text, i.e. it should work as part of reading a picturebook out loud.
A System Dynamics Approach for Hospital Waste Management in a City in a Developing Country: The Case of Nablus, Palestine	Hospitals and health centers provide a variety  of healthcare services and normally generate hazardous  waste as well as general waste. General waste has a  similar nature to that of municipal solid waste and  therefore could be disposed of in municipal landfills.  However, hazardous waste poses risks to public health,  unless it is properly managed. The hospital waste management system encompasses many factors, i.e., number  of beds, number of employees, level of service, population, birth rate, fertility rate, and not in my back yard (NIMBY) syndrome. Therefore, this management system requires a comprehensive analysis to determine the  role of each factor and its influence on the whole system. In this research, a hospital waste management simulation model is presented based on the system dynamics technique to determine the interaction among these factors in the system using a software package, ithink. This model is used to estimate waste segregation as this is important in the hospital waste management system to minimize risk to public health. Real data has been obtained from a case study of the city of Nablus,  Palestine to validate the model. The model exhibits  wastes generated from three types of hospitals (private,  charitable, and government) by considering the number  of both inpatients and outpatients depending on the  population of the city under study. The model also offers  the facility to compare the total waste generated among  these different types of hospitals and anticipate and  predict the future generated waste both infectious and  non-infectious and the treatment cost incurred.
Predicting Muscularity-Related Behavior, Emotions, and Cognitions in Men: The Role of Psychological Need Thwarting, Drive for Muscularity, and Mesomorphic Internalization	We examine the relationships that internalization, need thwarting (NT), and drive for muscularity (DFM), along with their interactions, had with weightlifting, muscle dissatisfaction (MD), and muscle-related-worry (MRW). A sample of 552 men (MAGE = 20.5 years, SD = 3.1) completed the Psychological Need Thwarting Scale, the Internalization subscale of the male version of the Sociocultural Attitudes Towards Appearance Questionnaire, the Drive for Muscularity Scale-Attitudes subscale, the Male Body Attitudes Scale-Muscularity subscale, the Body Change Inventory-Worry subscale, and an inventory assessing weightlifting behavior. DFM significantly predicted weightlifting, MRW, and MD.  Internalization significantly predicted weightlifting and MRW. NT significantly predicted weightlifting and MD, and its relationship with MRW approached significance. The interaction terms did not predict weightlifting or MRW. The NT/DFM and NT/Internalization interaction terms predicted MD. These results highlight the role of NT in predicting appearance variables in men.
Investigating Behaviour and Face Encoding in a Hypothetical Real-World Social Contract: Handwashing in Hazardous Health Settings	Investigations into the evolutionary origins of human cognition has shown that individuals’ memory for others is influenced by the latter’s behaviour in social contracts. Such research is primarily based on hypothetical or more abstract forms of social contracts, whereas an application of this knowledge to everyday health behaviours can be of great value. To address this, the current study investigated whether participants who were asked to imagine themselves in a hypothetical hazardous health scenario showed differential response sensitivity (d’) and latency (RT) to faces of hospital staff tagged with contrasting hand hygiene before touching patients: clean hands, dirty hands, or unknown hand-washing behaviour (control). The test used a two alternative forced-choice (2AFC: “old/new”) face recognition paradigm. The findings showed that d’ to dirty and clean hands was similar, but higher than for controls. Moreover, d’ was not affected by the occupation of hospital staff (nurses vs porters). The absence of memory gains towards clean or dirty hands points to the need for new strategies to remind patients to observe (and remember) the hand hygiene of others when exposed to hazardous health environments.
Police Officer Physical Fitness to Work: A Case for Health and Fitness Training	There is no reference point currently available to the Irish police force (An Garda Síochána) for measurement of baseline physical fitness or for tracking its current members, as no such data exists. Currently there is no defined health and fitness policy or strategy following a trainee Irish police force two year training period. Measurements of the various health-related components of physical fitness have been developed and, in some cases, standardised, with good to excellent accuracy and reliability (American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM, 2011), as physiological measures (as a proxy for actual physical fitness) with predictive accuracy of an individual?s health outcomes better than physical activity recall (Bovet et al., 2007). These measures were utilised within this research to ascertain if there were fitness changes within a group of Irish police force trainees during their period in college training. An improvement was predicted for the trainee group that was at odds with the actual findings. The focus of this particular study is to provide the information to establish if there is a need for mandatory health and fitness testing (while allowing for individual differences) for this unique Irish work force.
Exploring Intrinsic Gender Identity Using Second Life	Virtual Worlds (VWs) provide an environment to understand and explore notions of gender and identity, particularly given the ability for users to experiment with gender in online worlds. Our study analyses gender identity using the virtual space of Second Life (SL) to explore experiences and responses to gender in an avatar. We introduced 46 novice users to the VW of SL in order to see if real life gender influenced their choices of avatar. Participants selected the gender of their original avatar and once they were used to SL, they were then asked to change the gender of that avatar. We used mixed methods research consisting of paper based questionnaires (n=34) and focus groups (n=46) conducted in SL. Nearly all participants chose an initial avatar that reflected their real-life gender with females (n=22) reporting higher levels of identification with this initial avatar. Females were significantly more concerned with the gender-specific appearance of their initial avatar. On swapping gender, females reported higher levels of discomfort and many changed back before 7 minutes. Males (n=24) did not report significant discomfort with their changed-gender avatar and did not revert back to their original avatar as quickly. Our findings suggest that female participants in this study tended to reinforce gender binaries through such things as clothing, hairstyles and behaviors of their avatars. Male participants were less likely to experience discomfort through changing the gender of their avatar (with the males noting they still perceived an avatar with a female appearance as male).
Patients’ Views: Peer Support Worker On Inpatient Wards	Purpose: To explore patients’ experiences of intentional mental health peer support (PS)  Design/methodology/approach: Seven in depth interviews were carried out by an independent researcher with individual inpatients who volunteered via a PS worker following leaflet and poster distribution explaining the research on the two wards. Each recorded interview of thirteen questions was transcribed verbatim by the researcher and analysis identified common themes across the interviews.  Findings: An overarching theme of communication with patients was identified together with six main themes: person centeredness, practical support, building connections, emotional support, modelling hope, and recovery interventions. There were no negative comments expressed by interviewees.  Research limitations/implications: Small scale qualitative research allows in-depth exploration of experiences which is valuable in informing the further development of peer support.  Originality/value: There are very few published reports of inpatient experiences of peer support in inpatient settings.
Designing Circuit Warz: Enhancing Teachers' and Students' Creativity Through Problem-based Games-based Learning in The Computer Engineering Classroom	This paper argues that as students are increasingly digitally tethered to powerful, ‘always on’ mobile devices, new models of engagement and creative approaches to teaching and learning in engineering are required. Therefore, this paper explores the use of gamification and problem-based learning in an educational setting to increase student engagement and creativity. This paper provides a practical example of using game mechanics and demonstrates how a commercial game engine, in this case, Unity3D, can be used to create simulations to teach advanced electronic and electrical circuit theory. The Circuit Warz project is introduced and it is used to illustrate the ways in which engineering education might be reimagined to create engaging student learning experiences that are problem-centered and pedagogically sound.
Field Evaluation of a Competitive Lateral-flow Assay for  Detection of Alternaria brassicae in Vegetable Brassica Crops	On-site detection of inoculum of polycyclic plant pathogens could potentially contribute to management of disease outbreaks. A 6-min, in-field competitive immunochromatographic lateral flow device (CLFD) assay was developed for detection of Alternaria brassicae (the cause of dark leaf spot in brassica crops) in air sampled above the crop canopy. Visual recording of the test result by eye provides a detection threshold of approximately 50 dark leaf spot conidia. Assessment using a portable reader improved test sensitivity. In combination with a weather-driven infection model, CLFD assays were evaluated as part of an in-field risk assessment to identify periods when brassica crops were at risk from A. brassicae infection. The weather-driven model overpredicted A. brassicae infection. An automated 7-day multivial cyclone air sampler combined with a daily in-field CLFD assay detected A. brassicae conidia air samples from above the crops. Integration of information from an in-field detection system (CLFD) with weather-driven mathematical models predicting pathogen infection have the potential for use within disease management systems.
Changing Professional Identity in the Transition from Practitioner to Lecturer in Higher Education: an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis	This research explores the experiences of five professional practitioners from disciplines including teaching, youth work, sport and health who had become lecturers in Higher Education. Their experiences are considered using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis and tentative conclusions are reached on the meaning of such experiences for the individuals. The work extends previous studies (Shreeve 2010, 2011; Gourlay 2011a, 2011b; Boyd & Harris 2010) to consider the relationship between knowledge and influence and how institutional preference for knowledge gained from research impacts on the validity of knowledge derived from professional experience. The research finds shared feelings associated with inauthenticity and loss arising from concerns that the contribution of the professional in Higher Education is undervalued. The research challenges the assumption that professional practitioners adopt the professional identity of a lecturer in Higher Education instead finding that they create their own professional identities in the liminal space between the professional and academic domains, but points to difficulties associated with constructed nature of such professional identities within the institutional structure of a Higher Education institution.
Influence of an Enforced Fast Start on 10-km-Running Performance	The effects of an enforced fast-start on long distance performance are controversial and seem to depend on the athlete’s capacity to delay and tolerate metabolic disruption. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of an enforced fast-start on 10-km running performance and the influence of the some physiological and performance variables on the ability to tolerate an enforced fast-start during the running. Fifteen moderately-trained runners performed two 10-km time-trials: free-pacing (FP-TT) and fast-start (FS-TT). During FS-TT, speed during the first kilometer was 6% higher than in FP-TT. Maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max), peak velocity (PV), velocity associated with VO2max (vVO2max), ventilatory threshold, and running economy (RE) at 10 km·h-1, 12 km·h-1 and FP-TT average velocity (AV-10 km) were individually determined. There were no differences between FP-TT and FS-TT performance (45:01 ± 4:08 vs 45:11 ± 4:46 min:s, respectively, p=0.4). We observed that eight participants improved (+2.2%) their performance and were classified as positive responders (PR) and seven decreased (-3.3%) performance and were classified as negative responders (NR). Running speed  was significantly higher for PR between 6 km and 9.2 km (p<0.05) during FS-TT. In addition, PR presented higher PV (p=0.02) and vVO2max (p= 0.01) than NR, suggesting the PV and vVO2max might influence the ability to tolerate a fast-start strategy. In conclusion, there was an individual response to the enforced fast-start strategy during 10-km running, and those who improved performance also presented higher vVO2max and PV, suggesting a possible association between these variables and response to the strategy adopted.
The Development of an Inclusive Taxonomy for Classifying Global Fighting Traditions	A number of approaches have been made at classifying fighting traditions; such approaches tend to focus on specific elements such as a select culture (e.g. Armstrong, 1994; Donohue and Taylor, 1994) or are somewhat simplistic (e.g. Maliszewski, 1992; Reid and Croucher, 1983). None of the classifications offer a globally-inclusive approach to explain how, or why, fighting traditions developed. Holistically, however, each of the approaches can inform a new classification system and the development of an inclusive taxonomy to encompass fighting traditions globally. This paper consequently proposes that the adoption the taxonomy can provide a foundation from which to analyse the histo-philosophical basis for the development of individual fighting traditions.
Does Emotional Intelligence have a “Dark” Side? A Review of the Literature	Emotional intelligence (EI) was once touted as the ‘panacea’ for a satisfying and successful life. Consequently, there has been much emphasis on developing interventions to promote this personal resource in applied settings. Despite this, a growing body of research has begun to identify particular contexts when EI does not appear helpful and may even be deleterious to a person, or those they have contact with, suggesting a ‘dark’ side to the construct. This paper provides a review of emergent literature to examine when, why and how trait and ability EI may contribute to negative intrapersonal (psychological ill-health; stress reactivity) and interpersonal outcomes (emotional manipulation; antisocial behaviour). Negative effects were found to operate across multiple contexts (health, academic, occupational) however these were often indirect, suggesting that outcomes depend on pre-existing qualities of the person. Literature also points to the possibility of ‘optimal’ levels of EI – both within and across EI constructs. Uneven profiles of self-perceptions (trait facets) or actual emotional skills contribute to poorer outcomes, particularly emotional awareness and management. Moreover, individuals who possess high levels of skill but have lower self-perceptions of their abilities fare worse that those with more balanced profiles. Future research must now improve methodological and statistical practices to better capture EI in context and the negative corollary associated with high levels.
Interface of the Environment and Occurrence of Botrytis cinerea in Pre-symptomatic Tomato Crops	Botrytis cinerea (Grey mould) is a necrotrophic fungus infecting over 230 plant species worldwide. It can cause major pre- and post-harvest diseases of many agronomic and horticultural crops. Botrytis cinerea causes annual economic losses of 10–100 billion US dollars worldwide and instability in the food supply (Jin and Wu, 2015). Grey mould losses, either at the farm gate or later in the food chain, could be reduced with improved knowledge of inoculum availability during production. In this paper, we report on the ability to monitor Botrytis spore concentration in glasshouse tomato production ahead of symptom development on plants. Using a light weight and portable air sampler (microtitre immunospore trap) it was possible to quantify inoculum availability within hours. Also, this study investigated the spatial aspect of the pathogen with an increase of B. cinerea concentration in bio-aerosols collected in the lower part of the glasshouse (0.5 m) and adjacent to the trained stems of the tomato plants. No obvious relationship was observed between B. cinerea concentration and the internal glasshouse environmental parameters of temperature and relative humidity. However the occurrence of higher outside wind speeds did increase the prevalence of B. cinerea conidia in the cropping environment of a vented glasshouse. Knowledge of inoculum availability at time periods when the environmental risk of pathogen infection is high should improve the targeted use and effectiveness of control inputs.
Are Premorbid Abnormal Personality Traits Associated with  Behavioural and Psychological Symptoms in Dementia?	Objective: The study aims to investigate associations between behavioural and psychological symptoms  of dementia (BPSD) and abnormal premorbid personality traits.  Methods: Data were obtained from 217 patients with a diagnosis of probable Alzheimer’s disease. Behavioural  and psychological symptoms of late-onset dementia were assessed with the Neuropsychiatric  Inventory. Premorbid personality traits were assessed using the Standardised Assessment of Personality.  Abnormal premorbid personality traits were categorised with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of  Mental Disorders fourth edition and International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related  Health Problems—10 diagnostic criteria for personality disorders.  Results: Abnormal premorbid personality traits were associated with increased behavioural and psychological  symptoms in dementia. Cluster A (solitary/paranoid) premorbid personality traits were associated  with anxiety, depression and hallucinations. Cluster C (anxious/dependent) traits were associated with a  syndrome of depression.  Conclusions: The presence of Clusters A (solitary/paranoid) and C (anxious/dependent) abnormal  premorbid personality traits seems to affect the expression of certain behavioural and psychological  symptoms in dementia, depression in particular.

“By Looking Liking”: Baz Luhrmann's William Shakespeare's Romeo+Juliet	Twenty years since its release onto the big screen, Baz Luhrmann’s William Shakespeare’s Romeo+Juliet continues to attract viewers, divide critics and remain unchallenged, in a league of its own, when it comes to film adaptation of Shakespeare’s plays. This article begins with taking stock of reception directions which still dispute the field of film adaptation. Cued by Worthen’s “Performance Paradigm”, my argument positions Luhrmann’s film (his second at the time and the one to propel the Australian director into Hollywood fame) firmly in the cinematic and sees the film narrative not as opposed to the textual and/or spoken one, but as a complex citational practice developed at the level of oral, visual and written discourse.
Muscle Dysmorphia: Current Insights	Since 1997, there has been increasing research focused on Muscle Dysmorphia, a condition underpinned by people’s beliefs they have insufficient muscularity, in both the Western and non-western medical and scientific communities. Much of this empirical interest has surveyed nonclinical samples, and there is limited understanding of people with the condition beyond knowledge about their characteristics. Much existing knowledge about people with the condition is unsurprising and inherent in the definition of the disorder, such as dissatisfaction with muscularity and adherence to muscle-building activities. Only recently have investigators started to explore questions beyond these limited tautological findings that may give rise to substantial knowledge advances, such as the examination of masculine and feminine norms. There is limited understanding of additional topics such as etiology, prevalence, nosology, prognosis, and treatment. Further, the evidence is largely based on a small number of unstandardized case reports and descriptive studies (involving small samples), largely confined to Western (North American, British, and Australian) males. Although much research has been undertaken since the term Muscle Dysmorphia entered the psychiatric lexicon in 1997, there remains tremendous scope for knowledge advancement. A primary task in the short term is for investigators to examine the extent that the condition exists among well-defined populations to help determine the justification for research funding relative to other public health issues. A greater variety of research questions and designs may contribute to a broader and more robust knowledge base than currently exists. Future work will help clinicians assist a group of people whose quality of life and health is placed at risk by their muscular preoccupation.
BAP Guidelines on the Management of Weight Gain, Metabolic Disturbances and Cardiovascular Risk Associated With Psychosis and Antipsychotic Drug Treatment	Excess deaths from cardiovascular disease are a major contributor to the significant reduction in  life expectancy experienced by people with schizophrenia. Important risk factors in this are smoking, alcohol misuse, excessive weight gain  and diabetes. Weight gain also reinforces service users’ negative views of themselves and is a  factor in poor adherence with treatment. Monitoring of relevant physical health risk factors is  frequently inadequate, as is provision of interventions to modify these. These guidelines review  issues surrounding monitoring of physical health risk factors and make recommendations about an  appropriate approach. Overweight and obesity, partly driven by antipsychotic drug treatment, are  important factors contributing to the development of diabetes and cardiovascular disease in people  with schizophrenia. There have been clinical trials of many interventions for people experiencing  weight gain when taking antipsychotic medications but there is a lack of clear consensus regarding  which may be appropriate in usual clinical practice. These guidelines review these trials and make  recommendations regarding appropriate interventions. Interventions for smoking and alcohol misuse   are reviewed, but more briefly as these are similar to those recommended for the general population. The management of impaired fasting glycaemia and impaired glucose tolerance (‘pre-diabetes’), diabetes and other cardiovascular risks, such as dyslipidaemia, are also reviewed with respect to other currently available guidelines. These guidelines were compiled following a consensus meeting of experts involved in various aspects   of these problems. They reviewed key areas of evidence and their clinical implications. Wider issues relating to primary care/secondary care interfaces are discussed but cannot be resolved within guidelines such as these.
Realizing the Latent Potential in the Part-time Student Workforce	The purpose of this article is to challenge employers to make the best use of the latent potential of their part-time student workforce and to retain this talent postgraduation. The authors report research which shows that increasing numbers of university students are working part-time alongside their degree studies, while at the same time businesses are becoming more explicit about their requirements for graduate entrants, specifying a range of traits, behaviours and soft skills. The authors argue that this developing scenario affords an opportunity for university students working part-time to develop skills and business-related knowledge that are desirable to their respective employers in the longer term. However, the  desire to nurture and retain those individuals on graduation appears to be lacking. This article concludes by challenging both employers and students to embrace a longer term perspective for their mutual benefit.
An Enterprise Opportunity for Entrepreneurial Students: Student Enterprise Development and Experience Assessed through the Student Voice	Purpose:  This research investigates the effectiveness of an experiential learning approach, available to students in all disciplines that combined a hands-on entrepreneurial and enterprise experience with professional consultant mentoring by using a competition to win business start-up funding.   Design/methodology/approach:  Students at a UK university had the chance to enter a competition in which they developed an entrepreneurial idea and then designed and presented a business plan to win business start-up capital. Students who were entrepreneurially motivated, but who lacked capital to start up their business, were targeted, as these students have been argued to benefit the most from a combination of business plan training and entrepreneurial development.  Feedback and data was obtained from the students at each stage of the process and was thematically analysed to assess the development of students’ entrepreneurial skills and knowledge through the experience.   Findings:  The research found that the benefits gained from this approach included both enterprising and entrepreneurial skills, with the greatest impact being on student confidence and belief in their ability to start a business.  The practical skills had a ‘demystifying’ effect on students that made them feel like entrepreneurship and enterprise start-up were attainable.   Research limitations/implications:  The research focused on students at one UK University and centered on entrepreneurship in a retail business. The competition thus appealed mainly to students who were interested in retail start-up, thus leaving out some enterprising students whose feedback may have been different. In addition, while entrepreneurial skills are assessed in the data, the students who would be interested in the competition would be assumed to be proactive, and this skill was not able to be analyzed. This research is a single case, and thus could be enhanced by more cases and looking at other enterprise start-up means beyond retail.  Originality/value:  This research makes a case that, in light of literature critical of the use of business plan training in entrepreneurship education, certain students are appropriate candidates for this approach. Specific skills and knowledge can be developed in university students using a live enterprise experience, supported by entrepreneurial mentoring. By making the event extracurricular, the study sought to capture the feedback of students who self-selected into the program, who can benefit most from combined entrepreneurial and business-plan development experience.
Improving Patients’ Experience and Outcome of Total Joint Replacement: the RESTORE Programme	BACKGROUND: Total hip replacements (THRs) and total knee replacements (TKRs) are common elective procedures. In the REsearch STudies into the ORthopaedic Experience (RESTORE) programme, we explored the care and experiences of patients with osteoarthritis after being listed for THR and TKR up to the time when an optimal outcome should be expected.  OBJECTIVE: To undertake a programme of research studies to work towards improving patient outcomes after THR and TKR.    METHODS: We used methodologies appropriate to research questions: systematic reviews, qualitative studies, randomised controlled trials (RCTs), feasibility studies, cohort studies and a survey. Research was supported by patient and public involvement.    RESULTS: Systematic review of longitudinal studies showed that moderate to severe long-term pain affects about 7–23% of patients after THR and 10–34% after TKR. In our cohort study, 10% of patients with hip replacement and 30% with knee replacement showed no clinically or statistically significant functional improvement. In our review of pain assessment few research studies used measures to capture the incidence, character and impact of long-term pain. Qualitative studies highlighted the importance of support by health and social professionals for patients at different stages of the joint replacement pathway. Our review of longitudinal studies suggested that patients with poorer psychological health, physical function or pain before surgery had poorer long-term outcomes and may benefit from pre-surgical interventions. However, uptake of a pre-operative pain management intervention was low. Although evidence relating to patient outcomes was limited, comorbidities are common and may lead to an increased risk of adverse events, suggesting the possible value of optimising pre-operative management. The evidence base on clinical effectiveness of pre-surgical interventions, occupational therapy and physiotherapy-based rehabilitation relied on small RCTs but suggested short-term benefit. Our feasibility studies showed that definitive trials of occupational therapy before surgery and post-discharge group-based physiotherapy exercise are feasible and acceptable to patients. Randomised trial results and systematic review suggest that patients with THR should receive local anaesthetic infiltration for the management of long-term pain, but in patients receiving TKR it may not provide additional benefit to femoral nerve block. From a NHS and Personal Social Services perspective, local anaesthetic infiltration was a cost-effective treatment in primary THR. In qualitative interviews, patients and health-care professionals recognised the importance of participating in the RCTs. To support future interventions and their evaluation, we conducted a study comparing outcome measures and analysed the RCTs as cohort studies. Analyses highlighted the importance of different methods in treating and assessing hip and knee osteoarthritis. There was an inverse association between radiographic severity of osteoarthritis and pain and function in patients waiting for TKR but no association in THR. Different pain characteristics predicted long-term pain in THR and TKR. Outcomes after joint replacement should be assessed with a patient-reported outcome and a functional test.    CONCLUSIONS: The RESTORE programme provides important information to guide the development of interventions to improve long-term outcomes for patients with osteoarthritis receiving THR and TKR. Issues relating to their evaluation and the assessment of patient outcomes are highlighted. Potential interventions at key times in the patient pathway were identified and deserve further study, ultimately in the context of a complex intervention.
Interleukin-6 and Associated Cytokine Responses to An Acute Bout of High-intensity Interval Exercise: the Effect of Exercise Intensity and Volume	Acute increases in interleukin (IL)-6 following prolonged exercise are associated with the induction of a transient anti-inflammatory state (e.g., increases in IL-10) that is partly responsible for the health benefits of regular exercise. The purposes of this study were to investigate the IL-6–related inflammatory response to high-intensity interval exercise (HIIE) and to determine the impact of exercise intensity and volume on this response. Ten participants (5 males and 5 females) completed 3 exercise bouts of contrasting intensity and volume (LOW, MOD, and HIGH). The HIGH protocol was based upon standard HIIE protocols, while the MOD and LOW protocols were designed to enable a comparison of exercise intensity and volume with a fixed duration. Inflammatory cytokine concentrations were measured in plasma (IL-6, IL-10) and also determined the level of gene expression (IL-6, IL-10, and IL-4R) in peripheral blood. The plasma IL-6 response to exercise (reported as fold changes) was significantly greater in HIGH (2.70 ± 1.51) than LOW (1.40 ± 0.32) (P = 0.04) and was also positively correlated to the mean exercise oxygen uptake (r = 0.54, P < 0.01). However, there was no change in anti-inflammatory IL-10 or IL-4R responses in plasma or at the level of gene expression. HIIE caused a significant increase in IL-6 and was greater than that seen in low-intensity exercise of the same duration. The increases in IL-6 were relatively small in magnitude, and appear to have been insufficient to induce the acute systemic anti-inflammatory effects, which are evident following longer duration exercise.
Mini Review: An Unexplored Role for Peroxiredoxin in Exercise-induced Redox Signalling?	Peroxiredoxin (PRDX) is a ubiquitous oxoreductase protein with a conserved ionised thiol that permits catalysis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) up to a million times faster than any thiol-containing signalling protein. The increased production of H2O2 within active tissues during exercise is thought to oxidise conserved cysteine thiols, which may in turn facilitate a wide variety of physiological adaptations. The precise mechanisms linking H2O2 with the oxidation of signalling thiol proteins (phosphates, kinases and transcription factors) are unclear due to these proteins’ low reactivity with H2O2 relative to abundant thiol peroxidases such as PRDX. Recent work has shown that following exposure to H2O2 in vitro, the sulfenic acid of the PRDX cysteine can form mixed disulphides with transcription factors associated with cell survival. This implicates PRDX as an ‘active’ redox relay in transmitting the oxidising equivalent of H2O2 to downstream proteins. Furthermore, under oxidative stress, PRDX can form high molecular weight structures that can be secreted into the extracellular space, potentially acting as an extracellular ‘stress’ signal. There is extensive literature assessing non-specific markers of oxidative stress in response to exercise, however the PRDX catalytic cycle may offer a more robust approach for measuring changes in redox balance following exercise. This review discusses studies assessing PRDX-mediated cellular signalling and integrates the recent advances in redox biology with investigations that have examined the role of PRDX during exercise in humans and animals. Future studies should explore the role of PRDX as a key regulator of peroxide mediated-signal transduction during exercise in humans.
Mental Health Pharmacists Views on Shared Decision-Making for Antipsychotics in Serious Mental Illness	A qualitative study to look at the views of pharmacists working in mental health settings in relation to shared decision making, particularly as applied to decisions about the prescription of antipsychotics for those diagnosed with severe and enduring mental illnesses.
Parents’ Preparedness for Their Infants’ Discharge Following First-stage Cardiac Surgery: Development of a Parental Early Warning Tool	Aim The aim of this study was to explore parental preparedness for discharge and their experiences of going home with their infant after the first-stage surgery for a functionally univentricular heart.  Background Technological advances worldwide have improved outcomes for infants with a functionally univentricular heart over the last 3 decades; however, concern remains regarding mortality in the period between the first and second stages of surgery. The implementation of home monitoring programmes for this group of infants has improved this initial inter-stage survival; however, little is known about parents’ experiences of going home, their preparedness for discharge, and parents’ recognition of deterioration in their fragile infant.  Method This study was conducted in 2011–2013; eight sets of parents were consulted in the research planning stage in September, 2011, and 22 parents with children aged 0–2 years responded to an online survey during November, 2012–March, 2013. Description of categorical data and deductive thematic analysis of the open-ended questions were undertaken.  Results Not all parents were taught signs of deterioration or given written information specific to their baby. The following three themes emerged from the qualitative data: mixed emotions about going home, knowledge and preparedness, and support systems.  Conclusions Parents are not adequately prepared for discharge and are not well equipped to recognise deterioration in their child. There is a role for greater parental education through development of an early warning tool to address the gap in parents’ understanding of signs of deterioration, enabling appropriate contact and earlier management by clinicians.
Blurred Lines: Performance Enhancement, Common Mental Disorders and Referral in the U.K. Athletic Population	Through the awareness-raising efforts of several high-profile current and former athletes, the issue of common mental disorders (CMD) in this population is gaining increasing attention from researchers and practitioners alike. Yet the prevalence is unclear and most likely, under-reported. Whilst the characteristics of the sporting environment may generate CMD within the athletic population, it also may exacerbate pre-existing conditions, and hence it is not surprising that sport psychology and sport science practitioners are anecdotally reporting increased incidences of athletes seeking support for CMDs. In a population where there are many barriers to reporting and seeking help for CMD, due in part to the culture of the high performance sporting environment, anecdotal reports suggest that those athletes asking for help are approaching personnel who they are most comfortable talking to. In some cases, this may be a sport scientist, the sport psychologist or sport psychology consultant. Among personnel in the sporting domain, there is a perception that the sport psychologist or sport psychology consultant is best placed to assist athletes seeking assistance for CMD. However, sport psychology as a profession is split by two competing philosophical perspectives; one of which suggests that sport psychologists should work exclusively with athletes on performance enhancement, and the other views the athlete more holistically and accepts that their welfare may directly impact on their performance. To add further complication, the development of the profession of sport psychology varies widely between countries, meaning that practice in this field is not always clearly defined. This article examines case studies that illustrate the blurred lines in applied sport psychology practice, highlighting challenges with the process of referral in the U.K. athletic population. The article concludes with suggestions for ensuring the field of applied sport psychology is continually evolving and reconfiguring to ensure that it continues to meet the demands of its clients.
Exploring Alternative Terrain in the Rehabilitation and Treatment of Offenders: Findings from a Prison-based Music Project	The arts in prison settings have provided an alternative or complimentary component to rehabilitation. Despite increased interest, studies capturing the voice of offenders participating in projects and the long-term impact are limited. Data from semistructured interviews with 18 men who had taken part in a music-based project while incarcerated, including one group of five participants who were tracked for 18 months with supplemented data from correctional staff and official documentation, is presented. Participants of the art-based projects comment on changes they believe to have derived from participating in the project, particularly relating to emotions, self-esteem, self-confidence, communication and social skills. An exoffender sample of participants reported that participation in art projects provide experiences that promote beneficial skills that have been useful for post prison life.
Addressing Sexual Health Needs – an Essential Role for the Primary Care Nurse	This article explores how nurses in primary care settings continue to have difficulty in implementing sexual health discussions in normal practice. It identifies some of the real and perceived barriers in implementing this element of nursing care and also gives examples of how to integrate sexual health discussion into a consultation.
Dyslexia in General Practice Education: Considerations for Recognition and Support	Dyslexia is a common developmental learning difficulty, which persists throughout life. It is likely that those working in primary care will know, or even work with someone who has dyslexia. Dyslexia can impact on performance in postgraduate training and exams. The stereotypical characteristics of dyslexia, such as literacy difficulties, are often not obvious in adult learners. Instead, recognition requires a holistic approach to evaluating personal strengths and difficulties, in the context of a supportive relationship. Strategies to support dyslexic learners should consider recommendations made in formal diagnostic reports, and aim to address self-awareness and coping skills.
FITS into Practice: Translating Research into Practice in Reducing the Use of Anti-psychotic Medication for People with Dementia Living in Care Homes	Objectives: This paper reports on the acceptability and effectiveness of the FITS (Focussed Intervention Training and Support) into Practice Programme. This intervention was scaled up from an earlier cluster randomised-controlled trial that had proven successful in significantly decreasing antipsychotic prescribing in care homes.  Method: An in depth 10-day education course in person-centred care was delivered over a three-month period, followed by six supervision sessions. Participants were care-home staff designated as Dementia Care Coaches (DCCs) responsible for implementing interventions in 1 or 2 care homes. The course and supervision was provided by educators called Dementia Practice Development Coaches (DPDCs).  Effectiveness data included monitoring antipsychotic prescriptions, goal attainment, knowledge, attitudes and  implementation questionnaires. Qualitative data included case studies and reflective journals to elucidate issues of  implementation.  Results: Of the 100 DCCs recruited, 66 DCCs completed the programme. Pre-post questionnaires demonstrated increased  knowledge and confidence and improved attitudes to dementia. Twenty per cent of residents were prescribed  antipsychotics at baseline which reduced to 14% (31% reduction) with additional dose reductions being reported alongside improved personalised goal attainment. Crucial for FITS into Practice to succeed was the allocation and protection of time for the DCC to attend training and supervision and to carry out implementation tasks in addition to their existing job role. Evaluation data showed that this was a substantial barrier to implementation in a small number of homes.  Discussion and conclusions: The FITS into practice programme was well evaluated and resulted in reduction in  inappropriate anti-psychotic prescribing. Revisions to the intervention are suggested to maximise successful  implementation.
Voice-Recognition Augmented Performance Tools in Performance Poetry Pedagogy	This provocation shares findings from the use of bespoke voice recognition  performance software in a number of seminars (which  took place in the 2014–2016 academic years at Glasgow School of  Art, University of Warwick, and Falmouth University). The software,  made available through this publication, is a web-app which uses  Google Chrome’s native voice-recognition function. It can be used  as a digitally augmented performance tool for poetry and has  been adapted for use in teaching by emphasising certain formal  constraints and characteristics. The primary aims of this  provocation are to introduce the software and to encourage  further development.
Drawing in Duos: The Journeys and Intersections Collaboration Project Between Istanbul and Worcester	This paper focuses on a collaborative drawing project carried out between two undergraduate drawing courses, one in İstanbul and the other in Worcester, during the Fall 2015 semester. Duos -teams of two working remotely- took turns to work on the same drawing in correspondence for three months by means of communication and sharing the changing images on-line with one another. The project introduced a collaborative method of learning based on drawing, initiated cultural exchange and cooperation. The role of drawing in the project was critical due to the direct but gradual nature of transmitting meaning onto paper. Outcomes of this project consisted of a flexible and playful creation process for students making use of the element of chance. They sought alternate ways to finalize a drawing and experienced the benefits of artistic co-production. The project has the capacity to inspire artists, instructors and others interested in creative partnership in different disciplines and can be of value as an educational model.
Supporting Completion of an Online Continuing Professional Development Programme For Newly Qualified Practitioners: a Qualitative Evaluation	Background: Development programmes to support newly qualified practitioners gain confidence in their first professional role often show varied levels of engagement, due to competing priorities and demands. In Scotland, the Flying Start NHS® programme uses a structured programme of online and work-based learning with associated mentoring, to support individuals through an often difficult transition to become capable, confident practitioners. . Whilst the programme was generally well received, the factors leading to widely varying completion rates between professions and organisations were not well understood.  Aim: to identify the factors leading to successful completion of Flying Start, a transition programme for newly qualified practitioners.  Method: A qualitative approach was adopted to gather data from two groups of participants. Semi-structured telephone interviews were conducted with strategic and management level participants (n=23), from five health boards in Scotland. Semi-structured interviews (n=22) and focus groups (n=11) were conducted with practitioners within 6 months either side of completing the programme. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using framework analysis.  Results: Four key themes related to successful completion emerged from the analysis:  organisational support; the format of the programme; understanding completion; motivation and incentives to complete. Factors leading to successful completion were identified at programme, organisational and individual level. These included clear communication and signposting, up-to-date and relevant content, links with continuing professional development frameworks, effective leadership, mentor and peer support, setting clear standards for assessment, and facilitating appropriate IT access.  Conclusions: A strong strategic commitment to embedding a development programme for newly qualified practitioners can ensure the necessary support is available to encourage timely completion. The mentor’s role - to provide face-to-face support - is identified as a key factor in completion and is achieved through setting attainable targets, monitoring progress, and providing motivation. However organisational structures that facilitate the mentoring relationship are also necessary.
The Imperial Maritime League: British Navalism, Conflict, and the Radical Right, c.1907-1920	This article revises previous interpretations of the Imperial Maritime League, and adds new detail to our understanding of Edwardian patriotic leagues, by highlighting the relevance of radical right ideology. A product of division in the Navy League, the Imperial Maritime League channelled extra-parliamentary sentiment into specific navalist causes, and worked closely with likeminded newspaper editors and naval officers to challenge the Unionist leadership, Admiralty, and Navy League. The new league was ultimately undermined by British victory in the naval race, and the Navy League’s preparedness to react positively to the challenge of a new navalist league.
The Lived Experience of People with Mental Health and Substance Misuse Problems: Dimensions of Belonging	Introduction: People with co-occurring mental health and substance misuse problems are among the most excluded in society.  A need to feel connected to others has been articulated in the occupational science literature although the concept of belonging itself has not been extensively explored within this paradigm. This paper reports findings from research that explored the meaning  and experience of belonging for four people living with dual diagnosis in the United Kingdom.  Method: Researchers employed an interpretative phenomenological approach to the study. Four semi-structured interviews were carried out. The interviews were guided by questions around the meaning of belonging, barriers to belonging and how belonging and not belonging impacted on participants’ lives. Data analysis facilitated the identification of themes across individual accounts and enabled comparisons.  Findings: Data analysis identified four themes – belonging in family, belonging in place, embodied understandings of belonging and barriers to belonging.  Conclusion: The findings add further insights into the mutable nature of belonging. A link between sense of belonging and attachment theory has been proposed, along with a way to understand the changeable and dependent nature of belonging through ‘dimensions of belonging’.
Deceit and Dishonesty as Practice: The Comfort of Lying	Lying and deceit are instruments of power, used by social actors in the pursuit of their practices as they seek to maintain social order. All social actors, nurses included, have deceit and dishonesty within their repertoire of practice. Much of this is benign, well intentioned and a function of being sociable and necessary in the pursuit of social order in the healthcare environment. Lying and deceit from a sociological point of view, is a reflection of the different modes of domination that exist within a social space. French philosopher Pierre Bourdieu theorized about the way that symbolic power works within social space. The social structures and the agency of individual actors moving within it are interrelated and interdependent. Bourdieu's ideas will be used to theorize about real clinical experiences where acts of deceit can be identified and a case example will be presented. Nurses are actors in the social space of clinical care, and their world is complex, challenging, and often fraught with the contradictory demands and choices that reflect and influence their behaviours. An exploration of lying and deceit in nursing as an instrument in the modes of domination that persist enables us to challenge some of the assumptions that are made about the motives that cause or tempt nurses to lie as well as to understand the way on which they are sometimes lied to, according to the acts of domination that exist in the field. Lying or acting dishonestly is a powerful act that is intent on retaining stability and social order and could be seen to be a justification of lying and deceit. However, we need to pause and consider, in whose interests are we striving to create social order? Is it in the end about the comfort of patients or for the comfort of professionals?
Using Heritage to Promote Rural Places	The proliferation of brown signs informing people  they are entering a ‘historic market town’, ‘historic  riverside village’ and so on has become an everyday  feature in the UK. This reflects the growing use of  local heritage in its various guises to promote places  as tourist attractions; and this in turn can be seen as a  manifestation of the broader commodification of place.  The ‘historicising’ of place both reflects and  reproduces an interest in the past and in the  particularities of places. Such place promotional  efforts have a long history, particularly within an urban  context, but are increasingly deployed in what might  be seen as more mundane places, including villages  and small towns seeking to project themselves  through reference to some local historical or cultural  features that distinguish them from other places,  thereby marking them out as somewhere worth  visiting.
The Impact of Student Response Systems on the Learning Experience of Undergraduate Psychology Students	Student response systems (SRS) are hand-held devices or mobile phone polling systems which collate real-time, individual responses to on-screen questions. Previous research examining their role in higher education has highlighted both advantages and disadvantages of their use. This paper explores how different SRS influence the learning experience of psychology students across different levels of their programme. Across two studies, first year students’ experience of using Turningpoint clickers and second year students’ experience of using Poll Everywhere was investigated. Evaluations of both studies revealed that SRS has a number of positive impacts on learning, including enhanced engagement, active learning, peer interaction, and formative feedback. Technical and practical issues emerged as consistent barriers to the use of SRS. Discussion of these findings and the authors’ collective experiences of these technologies are used to provide insight into the way in which SRS can be effectively integrated within undergraduate psychology programmes.
Prosocial Behaviour in Palliative Nurses: Psychometric Evaluation of the Prosociality Scale	Aim: The aim of this study was to examine the psychometric properties of a prosociality scale within the palliative nursing context, and then examine the impact of prosocial behaviour in relation to job and educational satisfaction among palliative nurses.  Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted in 25 Italian palliative care centres, with a total of  107 nurses completing the prosociality scale by Caprara et al (2005). Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were  examined to evaluate a multidimensional model of prosociality.  Results: A three-factor solution with a second order factor  fitted the data well. The three dimensions extracted were labelled as helping, empathy, and sharing. Participants reported high levels of prosociality. In addition, prosociality was positively associated with job and educational satisfaction.  Conclusions: The prosociality scale was valid and reliable when tested with palliative nurses. Although prosociality may be embedded in nurses’ personalities, this quality should be actively promoted to expand and improve the culture and the ethics of nursing.
Capacity Management in Healthcare Services	The level of demand for healthcare services can fluctuate widely and this can place pressure on the capacity of service providers. This article examines some of the approaches used to influence the level of available capacity in the healthcare services sector. A number of strategies designed to flex capacity are discussed, including the development of flexible approaches to human resources; rapid responses to changes in demand; the use of self-service technology and self-care; and the use of temporary additional facilities.
Road Life Perspectives and Experiences Among Iranian Truck Drivers: a Qualitative Study	Truck drivers are one of the largest occupational groups in Iran. Evidence from previous studies suggests that working and living conditions on the road engender many concerns for truck drivers, and their families and communities. This research aimed to explore the experiences of Iranian truck drivers regarding life on the road.  This qualitative study was conducted among Iranian truck drivers working in the inter-state transportation sector. A purposeful sample of 20 truck drivers took part in this research. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews and analyzed based on qualitative content analysis.  After analysis of the data, three main themes emerged: "Individual impacts related to the hardships of life on the road life", "Family impacts related to the hardships of road life", and "Having positive attitude towards work and road". These findings represent the dimensions of perspectives in the road-life of truck drivers.  Although truck drivers possess positive beliefs about their occupation and life on the road, they and their families face many hardships which should be well understood. They also need support to be better able to solve the road-life concerns they face. This study's findings are useful for occupational programming and in the promotion of health for truck drivers.
Preliminary Results of an International Study Exploring and Comparing Positive Aspects and Concerns of Growing Older in Different Societies	This paper aims to gain an understanding and insight into the older person’s experiences and perceptions of growing older within their own societies in relation to their independence, choice and decision making. In an attempt to identify what is happening in different countries and cultures and to share these experiences, attitudes and perceptions from older people, this study asked people from three developing countries (Tanzania, Indonesia and Peru), from three different continents, to take part in this study.
Effectiveness and Cost-effectiveness of Outpatient Physiotherapy After Knee Replacement for Osteoarthritis: Study Protocol for a Randomised Controlled Trial	Background: Primary total knee replacement is a common operation that is performed to provide pain relief and restore functional ability. Inpatient physiotherapy is routinely provided after surgery to enhance recovery prior to hospital discharge. However, international variation exists in the provision of outpatient physiotherapy after hospital discharge. While evidence indicates that outpatient physiotherapy can improve short-term function, the longer term benefits are unknown. The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to evaluate the long-term clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 6-week group-based outpatient physiotherapy intervention following knee replacement.  Methods/design: Two hundred and fifty-six patients waiting for knee replacement because of osteoarthritis will be recruited from two orthopaedic centres. Participants randomised to the usual-care group (n = 128) will be given a booklet about exercise and referred for physiotherapy if deemed appropriate by the clinical care team. The intervention group (n = 128) will receive the same usual care and additionally be invited to attend a group-based outpatient physiotherapy class starting 6 weeks after surgery. The 1-hour class will be run on a weekly basis over  6 weeks and will involve task-orientated and individualised exercises.  The primary outcome will be the Lower Extremity Functional Scale at 12 months post-operative. Secondary outcomes include: quality of life, knee pain and function, depression, anxiety and satisfaction. Data collection will be by questionnaire prior to surgery and 3, 6 and 12 months after surgery and will include a resource-use questionnaire to enable a trial-based economic evaluation. Trial participation and satisfaction with the classes will be evaluated through structured telephone interviews. The primary statistical and economic analyses will be conducted on an intention-to-treat basis with and without imputation of missing data. The primary economic result will estimate the incremental cost per quality-adjusted life year gained from this intervention from a National Health Services (NHS) and personal social services perspective.  Discussion: This research aims to benefit patients and the NHS by providing evidence on the long-term effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of outpatient physiotherapy after knee replacement. If the intervention is found to be effective and cost-effective, implementation into clinical practice could lead to improvement in patients’ outcomes and improved health care resource efficiency.
The Hanging/hanged Patient and Relevance to Pre-hospital Care	Death and injury from hanging is a complex situation, which requires careful and appropriate assessment and management in the pre-hospital environment. It is arguably an area of limited understanding and therefore may not be assessed and managed in the most effective manner. Most hanged/hanging patients will be found in their homes, rather than in institutions. It could be argued that due to prevalence as a suicide method, the majority of pre-hospital ambulance service staff will be responded to at least one hanged or hanging patient within their careers, thus a greater understanding will benefit both clinician and patient. Patients who attempt or achieve suicide will rarely achieve fracturing the spine and severing the spinal cord, bringing into question the requirement for the traditional cervical collar and spinal immobilisation techniques. Death from asphyxiation and carotid/vagal reflex require consideration and management as does raised ICP, which is likely to occur.
Die Professionalisierung des Religionslehrerberufs als Aufgabe und Gegenstand Religionspädagogischer Forschung. Historische und Systematische Perspektiven	Current discussions on Religious Education (RE), both in Germany and England, focus on the quality of teaching and the professionality of teachers, but neglect the historical and institutional process of professionalisation upon which conceptions of teaching quality and teacher professionality hinge. This article seeks to provide definitional clarity by differentiating between individual and collective professionalisation; exploring teacher professionalisation in general and in the special case of RE; and operationalizing the concept of RE teacher professionalisation for the purposes of planned historical and international com- parative research. A threefold conceptualisation of professionalisation is propo- sed, consisting of the following inter-related levels: (1) initial and continuing professional development; (2) professional self-organisation and professional politics; and (3) professional knowledge. The breadth, complexity and signi- ficance of the historical and institutional processes associated with the pro- fessionalisation of RE teachers at each of these levels is described and discussed. It is argued that further historical and international comparative research on these lines would contribute a broader and deeper understanding of the presuppositions of RE teacher professionality beyond current debates.
In Protection of Whose “Wellbeing”? Considerations of “Clauses and A/Effects” in Athlete Contracts	Contractual agreements have become an accepted part of participation processes for athletes in a variety of sport contexts. Closer readings of these contracts,however, pose several questions regarding organizational intentions and motivations,the conceptualization of athletes as “workers,” and representation parity. In this article, we draw on four types of athlete contractual documents from both select  international “amateur” and “professional” sport settings. Our key considerations include athletes’ ownership over their image and identities; medical and health disclosures; lifestyle, behavioral and body choices, and restrictions beyond sport; adherence to organizational philosophy and commitments; and social media and publicity constraints. Our exegesis here encourages sport researchers to deliberate  whose “wellbeing” matters most when signing that seductive dotted line.
Creating Courses for Adults: Design for Learning (Book Review)	The key idea of the book is that courses for adults need to be designed and not just put together haphazardly without careful thought and planning. This central argument  is reflected in the title of the book, which sees ‘creating’ and ‘design for learning’ as core ideas and permeates the thinking and framework offered as a template for designing learning. For me, this reflects the balance between flexibility and structure that is needed for designing and teaching courses for adults in a variety of contexts.
No Joke: Understanding Public Sentiment Toward Selling and Salespeople Through Cartoon Analysis	Unflattering representations of salesmanship in mass media exist in abundance. In order to gauge the depiction of selling in mass media, this article explores the nature and public perceptions of salesmanship using editorial cartoons. A theory of cartooning suggests that editorial cartoons reflect public sentiment toward events and issues and therefore provide a useful way of measuring and tracking such sentiment over time. The criteria of narrative, location, binary struggle, normative transference, and metaphor were used as a framework to analyze 286 cartoons over a 30-year period from 1983 to 2013. The results suggest that while representations of the characteristics and behaviors of salespeople shifted very little across time periods, changes in public perceptions of seller–buyer conflict, the role of the customer, and selling techniques were   observed, thus indicating that cartoons are sensitive enough to measure the portrayal of selling.
Beyond the Acronyms: Sport Diplomacy and the Classification of the International Olympic Committee	Diplomacy often finds itself reduced to actions centred on states. However, after the Cold War, international relations and diplomacy have expanded with different actors growing into significant roles, particularly in the increase of diplomatic relations in the context of sport. The classification and significance of other actors remains under-researched in relation to sport, with literature focusing more on the growth of new and varying practices of diplomacy. This analysis contends that there is a need to interrogate fundamental components of modern diplomacy—with the actor being the focus—more specifically the classification of sports organisations in diplomacy. It is relevant as a more accurate understanding of sports organisations will contribute to how diplomatic studies can analyse and evaluate modern diplomacy within the context of sport. The International Olympic Committee is the actor used to illustrate how problematic classifications currently in the academic literature translate into weak and reduced analysis and evaluation of its role and significance in diplomacy. As counterpoint, this analysis proposes an analytical framework of socio-legal theory that harnesses legal regulation as a benchmark to classify an actor’s capacity within a society. In consequence, the IOC is as an active and significant contributor to the ever expanding and complex diplomatic environment and wider society.
Technology is Set to Change Real Estate Forever	Major developments in the technological environment can become commonplace very quickly. They are now impacting upon a broad range of information-based service sectors, as high growth Internet-based firms, such as Google, Amazon, Facebook and Airbnb, and financial technology (Fintech) start-ups expand their product portfolios into new markets.    Real estate is one of the information-based service sectors that is currently being impacted by this new type of competitor and the broad range of disruptive digital technologies that have emerged. Due to the vast troves of data that these Internet firms have at their disposal and their asset-light (cloud-based) structures, they are able to offer highly-targeted products at much lower costs than conventional brick-and-mortar companies.
Apple Pollination: Demand Depends on Variety and Supply Depends on Pollinator Identity	Insect pollination underpins apple production but the extent to which different pollinator  guilds supply this service, particularly across different apple varieties, is unknown. Such  information is essential if appropriate orchard management practices are to be targeted and  proportional to the potential benefits pollinator species may provide. Here we use a novel  combination of pollinator effectiveness assays (floral visit effectiveness), orchard field surveys  (flower visitation rate) and pollinator dependence manipulations (pollinator exclusion  experiments) to quantify the supply of pollination services provided by four different pollinator  guilds to the production of four commercial varieties of apple. We show that not all pollinators  are equally effective at pollinating apples, with hoverflies being less effective than  solitary bees and bumblebees, and the relative abundance of different pollinator guilds visiting  apple flowers of different varieties varies significantly. Based on this, the taxa specific  economic benefits to UK apple production have been established. The contribution of insect  pollinators to the economic output in all varieties was estimated to be £92.1M across the  UK, with contributions varying widely across taxa: solitary bees (£51.4M), honeybees  (£21.4M), bumblebees (£18.6M) and hoverflies (£0.7M). This research highlights the differences  in the economic benefits of four insect pollinator guilds to four major apple varieties in  the UK. This information is essential to underpin appropriate investment in pollination services  management and provides a model that can be used in other entomolophilous crops  to improve our understanding of crop pollination ecology.
A Community-Level, Mesoscale Analysis of Fish Assemblage Structure in Shoreline Habitats of a Large River Using Multivariate Regression Trees.	The mesoscale (100–102 m) of river habitats has been identified as the scale that simultaneously offers insights into ecological structure and falls within the practical bounds of river management. Mesoscale habitat (mesohabitat) classifications for relatively large rivers, however, are underdeveloped compared with those produced for smaller streams. Approaches to habitat modelling have traditionally focused on individual species or proceeded on a species-by-species basis. This is particularly problematic in larger rivers where the effects of biological interactions are more complex and intense. Community-level approaches can rapidly model many species simultaneously, thereby integrating the effects of biological interactions while providing information on the relative importance of environmental variables in structuring the community. One such community-level approach, multivariate regression trees, was applied in order to determine the relative influences of abiotic factors on fish assemblages within shoreline mesohabitats of San Pedro River, Chile, and to define reference communities prior to the planned construction of a hydroelectric power plant.      Flow depth, bank materials and the availability of riparian and instream cover, including woody debris, were the main variables driving differences between the assemblages. Species strongly indicative of distinctive mesohabitat types included the endemic Galaxias platei. Among other outcomes, the results provide information on the impact of non-native salmonids on river-dwelling Galaxias platei, suggesting a degree of habitat segregation between these taxa based on flow depth. The results support the use of the mesohabitat concept in large, relatively pristine river systems, and they represent a basis for assessing the impact of any future hydroelectric power plant construction and operation. By combing community classifications with simple sets of environmental rules, the multivariate regression trees produced can be used to predict the community structure of any mesohabitat along the reach.
FIL Benchmarking Project	Write up of a workshop which took place at Interlend 2015, the annual conference of the Forum for Interlending and Information Delivery, held in Manchester. The workshop followed on from the presentation of the results of the FIL Benchmarking Project Survey in 2014, and was intended to facilitate discussion of the findings, with a view to establishing best practice.
Expert Insight into the Assessment of Competence in Cognitive–behavioural Therapy: a Qualitative Exploration of Experts' Experiences, Opinions and Recommendations	To offer insight into how cognitive–behavioural therapy (CBT) competence is deﬁned, measured and evaluated and to highlight ways in which the assessment of CBT competence could be further improved, the current study utilizes a qualitative methodology to examine CBT experts’ (N = 19) experiences of conceptualizing and assessing the competence of CBT therapists. Semi-structured interviews  were used to explore participants’ experiences of assessing the competence of CBT therapists. Interview  transcripts were then analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis in order to identify commonalities and differences in the way CBT competence is evaluated. Four superordinate themes were  identiﬁed: (i) what to assess, the complex and fuzzy concept of CBT competence; (ii) how to assess  CBT competence, selecting from the toolbox of assessment methods; (iii) who is best placed to assess  CBT competence, expertise and independence; and (iv) pitfalls, identifying and overcoming assessment  biases. Priorities for future research and ways in which the assessment of CBT competence could be further improved are discussed in light of these ﬁndings.
More Than a Wallet: Serving the Older Consumer	Considers the values, behaviour and needs of older shoppers in terms of interactions with employees; interactions with other shoppers present in the retail environment; and physical aspects of the retail environment.
It’s Cheaper than Acquiring New Ones: Retaining Members to Your Service	The benefits of retention are well known: it’s cheaper and easier to retain existing customers than it is to try to acquire new ones. Secondly, retained customers play a vital role in the acquisition of new customers through word-of-mouth. Thirdly, retained customers have a higher monetary value, due to being more susceptible to cross-selling initiatives.    So, retention is important. But, it’s difficult to achieve, especially for membership organisations. Numerous organisations work on a membership-based business model, such as health clubs, trade unions, charities and even professional associations. Often, recruiting and retaining members is fundamental to the success of these enterprises which rely on membership fees as their primary revenue stream.
The Continuing Search to Find a More Effective and Less Intimidating Way to Teach Research Methods in Higher Education	Existing literature examining the teaching of research methods highlights difficulties students face when developing research competencies. Studies of student-centered teaching approaches have found increased student performance and improved confidence in undertaking research projects. To develop a student-centered approach, it could be beneficial to teach students through active participation, with the development of their research agendas as the basis for progression. To develop this goal, the research methods module for graduate students at a UK business school was restructured into a two-week block utilizing a student-centered approach. The performance of the students was then compared to the performance of students who undertook the same course material presented in a traditional semester-long module and the results were then statistically analyzed. The results of this study provide new and interesting evidence of increased student achievement and understanding through the new format and provide new avenues for future research.
Employability and the UseMyAbility Online Tool: Raising Sports Students’ Awareness to Inform the Development of Their Skills and Attributes	The collaborative project UseMyAbility (UMA) sought to reduce discrimination and enhance disabled graduates’ employability through equipping them with the skills to match employability skills and attributes. An outcome from the project, completed in 2011, was a web-based tool which gave students advice on how to improve their employability. Subsequently, an online self-audit questionnaire was developed, which allowed students to record and map their employability skills and attributes. This paper reports on two projects that used this UMA online questionnaire with undergraduate sports students at a UK University. The first group were students undertaking a second-year Physical Education (PE) module and the second were students undertaking internships in a variety of sporting contexts. Drawing on data gained from questionnaires and student and mentor interviews, the two projects sought to evaluate the effectiveness of the UMA questionnaire for the students in these two contexts. It aimed to enhance students’ employability profiles, enable them to benchmark and track their development, provide practical help in preparing job applications, tackle interview questions and develop evidence-based curricula vitae. It is hoped that through identifying ways of adapting the use of the questionnaire to these contexts, learning from participant data from the completion of the questionnaires, and gaining a better understanding of students’ and mentors’ perceptions of its use, that insights may be gained that will aid the wider adoption of the online tool.
Conceptualizing and Researching the Professionalization of Religious Education Teachers: Historical and International Perspectives	Current discussions on Religious Education (RE), both in Germany and England, focus on the quality of teaching and the professionality of teachers, but neglect the historical and institutional process of professionalization upon which conceptions of teaching quality and teacher professionality hinge. This article seeks to provide definitional clarity by differentiating between individual and collective professionalization; exploring teacher professionalization in general and in the special case of RE; and operationalizing the concept of RE teacher professionalization for the purposes of planned historical and international comparative research. A three-fold conceptualization of professionalization is proposed, consisting of the following inter-related levels: (1) initial and continuing professional development; (2) professional self-organization and professional politics; and (3) professional knowledge. The breadth, complexity and significance of the historical and institutional processes associated with the professionalization of RE teachers at each of these levels is described and discussed. It is argued that further historical and international comparative research on these lines would contribute a broader and deeper understanding of the presuppositions of RE teacher professionality beyond current debates.
Lancashire Conservatives, Tariff Reform and Indian Responsible Government	The success of Tory Democracy in Lancashire heightened its influence in Conservative party debates about tariff reform and India. New Delhi’s imposition of tariffs from 1917 prompted Lancashire Conservatives to gradually modify their position on free trade, so that by 1931 they supported imperial preference. India’s reluctance to lower tariffs led many to criticise the 1933 India white paper. Historians have examined front bench and die-hard conservative efforts to win over Lancashire, but they have overlooked the extent to which local feeling and activism on India was native to the county and not imported from Westminster.
A Reflective Encounter With the Fine Sand Area in a Nursery School Setting	This article draws on a model of reflection that involves creating meanings through repeated encounters with evocative objects. Responses to one such evocative object, a 20-second video clip of children playing in the fine sand area, illustrates the “turning toward” and then “turning away” from the object to engage with broader themes. Parten’s play types are used when analyzing children’s play in the fine sand area (the evocative object). The focus then turns away to themes of English as a second language, messy play, energies of childhood, and Foucault’s docile bodies. The intention was to integrate loosely formulated research aims relating to quality of the physical environment within the evolving life of the nursery setting to encourage a developing research orientation and reflective dis-position. This way of approaching practitioner research is well adapted to a longer-term engagement with enduring areas of interest, such as developing the potential of the physical environment.
Clinical Psychologists Training and Supervising IAPT Therapists to Work with Long-term Conditions and Medically Unexplained Symptoms: A Service Development Project	An IAPT service and a clinical health psychology team piloted a service development providing Step 2 and Step 3  services for individuals with long-term health conditions. Results indicate that such services may be offered with  access to specialist training and supervision.
The Influence of Performance Level, Age and Gender on Pacing Strategy During a 100-km Ultramarathon	The aim of this study is to analyse the influence of performance level, age and gender on pacing during a 100-km ultramarathon. Results of a 100-km race incorporating the World Masters Championships were used to identify differences in relative speeds in each 10-km segment between participants finishing in the first, second, third and fourth quartiles of overall positions (Groups 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively). Similar analyses were performed between the top and bottom 50% of finishers in each age category, as well as within male and female categories. Pacing varied between athletes achieving different absolute performance levels. Group 1 ran at significantly lower relative speeds than all other groups in the first three 10-km segments (all P < 0.01), and significantly higher relative speeds than Group 4 in the 6th and 10th (both P < 0.01), and Group 2 in the 8th (P = 0.04). Group 4 displayed significantly higher relative speeds than Group 2 and 3 in the first three segments (all P < 0.01). Overall strategies remained consistent across age categories, although a similar phenomenon was observed within each category whereby ‘top’ competitors displayed lower relative speeds than ‘bottom’ competitors in the early stages, but higher relative speeds in the later stages. Females showed lower relative starting speeds and higher finishing speeds than males. ‘Top’ and ‘bottom’ finishing males displayed differing strategies, but this was not the case within females. Although pacing remained consistent across age categories, it differed with level of performance within each, possibly suggesting strategies are anchored on direct competitors. Strategy differs between genders and differs depending on performance level achieved in males but not females.
Forecasting Methodologies for Ganoderma Spore Concentration  Using Combined Statistical Approaches and Model Evaluations	High concentration levels of Ganoderma spp. spores were observed in Worcester, UK, during 2006–2010.These basidiospores are known to cause sensitization due to  the allergen content and their small dimensions. This enables them to penetrate the lower part of the respiratory tract in humans. Establishment of a link between occurring symptoms of sensitization to Ganoderma spp. and other basidiospores is challenging due to lack of information regarding spore concentration in the air. Hence, aerobiological monitoring should be conducted, and if possible extended with the construction of forecast models. Daily mean concentration of allergenic Ganoderma spp. spores in the atmosphere of Worcester was measured using 7-day volumetric spore sampler through five consecutive years. The relationships between the presence of spores in the air and the weather parameters were examined. Forecast models were constructed for Ganoderma spp. spores using advanced statistical techniques, i.e. multivariate regression trees and artificial neural networks. Dew point temperature along with maximumtemperature was the most important factor influencing the presence of spores in the air of Worcester. Based on these two major factors and several others of lesser importance, thresholds for certain levels of fungal spore concentration, i.e. low (0–49 s m−3), moderate(50–99 s m−3), high (100–149 s m−3) and very high (150<n s m−3), could be designated. Despite some deviation in results obtained by artificial neural networks, authors have achieved a forecasting model, which was accurate (correlation between observed and predicted values varied from rs=0.57 to rs=0.68).
Learning at the Interstices; Locating Practical Philosophies for Understanding Physical/virtual Inter-spaces	Virtual worlds are relatively recent developments, and so it is tempting to believe that they need to be understood through newly developed theories and philosophies. However, humans have long thought about the nature of reality and what it means to be “real.” This paper examines the three persistent philosophical concepts of Metaxis, Liminality and Space that have evolved across more than 2000 years of meditation, contemplation and reflection. Our particular focus here is on the nature of the interface between the virtual and the physical: at the interstices, and how the nature of transactions and transitions across those interfaces may impact upon learning. This may, at first, appear to be an esoteric pursuit, but we ground our arguments in primary and secondary data from research studies in higher education.
Governor and Course Leaders’ Reflections on HE in FE: Strategic Ambition and Curriculum Practice in Two Large Colleges in England	In the turbulent ‘dog eat dog’ environment of the learning and skills sector in England the provision and expansion of higher education taught in further education colleges (HE in FE) offers potential opportunities for greater diversification of higher education. However, it also presents significant challenges, which include developing an HE culture, managing shifting partnerships, and ensuring  the curriculum meets benchmarks for quality and standards of provision. This article uses principles of appreciative enquiry to explore the experience, potential and challenge of growing HE in FE in two large colleges, one located in an  urban area and the other in a rural region of central England. Both colleges reflect similarities and differences in their strategy and delivery of HE in FE and neither uses the term ‘further’ to describe its provision. This shift in branding reflects the strategic ambitions of governors and senior leaders as the curriculum offer is no longer general ‘further education’ but much more diverse, and  includes HE courses delivered in partnership with four universities. Using data from governing bodies, cross-college committees and course leaders we reflect on the spaces and places for growing HE in FE and the challenges it poses for governors, leaders, tutors and students.
Appraising and Reconfiguring HE in FE Through Research and Critical Perspectives	Educational research is famously ‘systematic enquiry made public’ (Stenhouse 1975: 142), but we now know it is also a public and political exercise in which groups come to share their values and beliefs in trying to understand what is happening and what actions can be taken (Shipman, 1997). We are going through a war on epistemology, as well as on ideology (Apple 2015) and in that sense, the group of scholars populating this special issue with research articles are exploring and challenging the ways in which HE in FE could be better viewed, defined and imagined in the present and in the future.  In this introduction we maintain that HE in FE is a contested zone, however for clarity we need to explain that the focus of this special issue is higher education partly or wholly taught away from universities in further education colleges and their equivalent outside of England.
Finding the ‘A-ha’ Moment: an Exploration into HE  in FE Teacher Self-Concept	Five teachers of higher education (HE)-level courses working in the further education  (FE) sector recalled critical moments which helped to form their self-concepts.  The researchers used life history method to encourage the teachers to be  open about their lives and how they formed their personal and professional  selves. Three common themes were discovered: a strong work ethic, resilience  and ‘being caring’. The paper describes and examines the critical moments in  the teachers’ lives which helped to form the self-concepts which have seen them  achieve in their professional lives, and examines whether the common themes  might be indicative of the types of characteristics needed to be a teacher of HE  in FE.
Global Commercial Surrogacy and International Adoption: Parallels and Differences	Over the decades, there have been numerous trends in the formation of family for those experiencing infertility. Adoption – initially domestic but now mostly international – has long been a prevailing method, with a dual outcome of also finding homes for parentless children. Those would-be parents with a stronger desire for genetic relatedness have turned to assisted reproductive technologies for the creation of their families. In the 21st century, capitalising on globalisation and advances in medical sciences and communication, global commercial surrogacy (GCS) is emerging as a dominant method of family formation. In seeking to publish this article in Adoption & Fostering, our primary objective was to provide its readership with an introductory look at GCS, thereby expanding an awareness of surrogacy to an audience whose work has traditionally been concerned with the care and protection of children through foster care and adoption. A secondary aim was to see where the long-standing field of adoption could potentially inform the burgeoning field of global commercial surrogacy. To achieve these objectives, we use international adoption and the adoption triangle as a framework, as we look at the similarities and differences between: (1) the adoptive and commissioning parents; (2) the birth mother and the surrogate; and (3) the adopted children and the children born of global surrogacy.
Perceived Social Pressures and the Internalization of the Mesomorphic Ideal: the Role of Drive for Muscularity and Autonomy in Physically Active Men	BACKGROUND:  Researchers have tested the beliefs of sportspeople and sports medicine specialists that cognitive strategies influence strength performance. Few investigators have synthesised the literature.  OBJECTIVES:  The specific objectives were to review evidence regarding (a) the cognitive strategy-strength performance relationship; (b) participant skill level as a moderator; and (c) cognitive, motivational, biomechanical/physiological, and emotional mediators.  METHOD:  Studies were sourced via electronic databases, reference lists of retrieved articles, and manual searches of relevant journals. Studies had to be randomised or counterbalanced experiments with a control group or condition, repeated measures, and a quality control score above 0.5 (out of 1). Cognitive strategies included goal setting, imagery, self-talk, preparatory arousal, and free choice. Dependent variables included maximal strength, local muscular endurance, or muscular power.  RESULTS:  Globally, cognitive strategies were reliability associated with increased strength performance (results ranged from 61 to 65 %). Results were mixed when examining the effects of specific strategies on particular dependent variables, although no intervention had an overall negative influence. Indeterminate relationships emerged regarding hypothesised mediators (except cognitive variables) and participant skill level as a moderator.  CONCLUSIONS:  Although cognitive strategies influence strength performance, there are knowledge gaps regarding specific types of strength, especially muscular power. Cognitive variables, such as concentration, show promise as possible mediators.
When is the Best Time to Sample Aquatic Macroinvertebrates in Ponds for Biodiversity Assessment?	Ponds are sites of high biodiversity and conservation value, yet there is little or no statutory monitoring of them across most of Europe. There are clear and standardized protocols for sampling aquatic macroinvertebrate communities in ponds but the most suitable time(s) to undertake the survey(s) remains poorly specified. This paper examined the aquatic macroinvertebrate communities from 95 ponds within different landuse types over three seasons (spring, summer and autumn) to determine the most appropriate time to undertake sampling to characterise biodiversity. The combined samples from all three seasons provided the most comprehensive record of the aquatic macroinvertebrate taxa recorded within ponds (alpha and gamma diversity). Samples collected during the autumn survey yielded significantly greater macroinvertebrate richness (76% of the total diversity) than either spring or summer surveys. Macroinvertebrate diversity was greatest during autumn in meadow and agricultural ponds but taxon richness among forest and urban ponds did not differ significantly temporally. The autumn survey provided the highest measures of richness for Coleoptera, Hemiptera and Odonata. However, richness of the aquatic insect order Trichoptera was highest in spring and lowest in autumn. The results illustrate that multiple surveys, covering more than one season, provide the most comprehensive representation of macroinvertebrate biodiversity. When sampling can only be undertaken on one occasion, the most appropriate time to undertake surveys to characterise the macroinvertebrate community biodiversity is during the autumn; although this may need to be modified if other floral and faunal groups need to be incorporated in to the sampling programme.
Effects of Social Media Platform Preference: a Country Comparison of Online University Reputations	Managing an online reputation is critical to higher education.  Universities cannot afford to lose enrolment numbers by neglecting to monitor, control, promote and enhance their online presence.  It is critical that universities measure their social media reputation scores and presence on the web, as well as those of their competitors.  Universities need to continuously review their social engagement strategy and online reputation to ensure they maximize all opportunities to maintain, and improve student enrolment and retention.      Universities have embraced social media to enhance their brand reputation. This study examines the use of social media and its effects from a global perspective. It analysed 90 universities in three geographical areas to assess the impact and level of online social media, especially as it relates to “university brand reputation.”  Results of the study indicated there was a wide variation among the three geographical regions, and within countries in the three geographical regions. Use of social media communication tools such as Twitter and Google+ by active users also varied widely depending upon country and region.
Polygenic Interactions with Environmental Adversity in the Aetiology of Major Depressive Disorder	Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and disabling condition with well-established heritability and environmental risk factors. Gene–environment interaction studies in MDD have typically investigated candidate genes, though the disorder is known to be highly polygenic. This study aims to test for interaction between polygenic risk and stressful life events (SLEs) or childhood trauma (CT) in the aetiology of MDD.    The RADIANT UK sample consists of 1605 MDD cases and 1064 controls with SLE data, and a subset of 240 cases and 272 controls with CT data. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were constructed using results from a mega-analysis on MDD by the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. PRS and environmental factors were tested for association with case/control status and for interaction between them.    PRS significantly predicted depression, explaining 1.1% of variance in phenotype (p = 1.9 × 10−6). SLEs and CT were also associated with MDD status (p = 2.19 × 10−4 and p = 5.12 × 10−20, respectively). No interactions were found between PRS and SLEs. Significant PRSxCT interactions were found (p = 0.002), but showed an inverse association with MDD status, as cases who experienced more severe CT tended to have a lower PRS than other cases or controls. This relationship between PRS and CT was not observed in independent replication samples.    CT is a strong risk factor for MDD but may have greater effect in individuals with lower genetic liability for the disorder. Including environmental risk along with genetics is important in studying the aetiology of MDD and PRS provide a useful approach to investigating gene–environment interactions in complex traits.
Wither Multiculturalism? – an Analysis of the Impact on Welfare Practice and Theory of Policy Responses to an Increasingly Multicultural Society in the UK	The UK is becoming an increasingly multicultural society, driven by a variety of demographic changes, particularly increased net migration from EU10 and the EU2 enlargement over the last 20 years.  In response to this, there have been two main policy focus, that of reducing immigration and limiting entitlement to welfare benefits for migrants.  This article will analyse the challenges that the latter of these policy changes in particular pose for practice, both in terms of its application and its theoretical implications.  In terms of practice application, the paper outlines how the limitation of entitlement to welfare benefits on the one hand amplifies already existing issues, and on the other creates new challenges for social welfare practitioners with migrant groups.  In terms of theoretical implications, the paper will outline how these policies reflects a retreat in policy away from multiculturalism towards assimilation, such as in relation to specifying the assimilation of ‘Britishness’ and ‘British values’ in daily life. Underpinning this retreat from multiculturalism is a changed citizenship, or more specifically the diminution of social citizenship rights integral to being complete citizens.
Alternaria Spores in the Air Across Europe: Abundance,  Seasonality and Relationships with Climate, Meteorology  and Local Environment	We explored the temporal and spatial variations in airborne Alternaria spore quantitative and phenological features in Europe using 23 sites with annual time series between 3 and 15 years. The study covers seven countries and four of the main biogeographical regions in Europe. The observations were obtained with Hirst-type spore traps providing time series with daily records. Site locations extend from Spain in the south to Denmark in the north and from England in the West to Poland in the East. The study is therefore the largest assessment ever carried out for Europe concerning Alternaria. Aerobiological data were investigated for temporal and spatial patterns in their start and peak season dates and their spore indices. Moreover, the effects of climate were checked using meteorological data for the same period, using a crop growth model. We found that local climate, vegetation patterns and management of landscape are governing parameters for the overall spore concentration, while the annual variations caused by weather are of secondary importance but should not be neglected. The start of the Alternaria spore season varies by several months in Europe, but the peak of the season is more synchronised in central-northern Europe in the middle of the summer, while many southern sites have peak dates either earlier or later than northern Europe. The use of a crop growth model to explain the start and peak of season suggests that such methods could be useful to describe Alternaria seasonality in areas with no available observations.
Development Assessment Centres: Practice Implications Arising from Exploring the Participant Voice	This qualitative phenomenological study explores the short-to-medium term personal impact of Development Assessment Centres on UK healthcare managers. The study identified overarching themes relating to personal performance impact, enabling and disabling factors in Centre design, trauma and safety implications, and behavioural adaptation. Practice implications arising focused upon three key areas. Firstly, Centre design should equally enable both introverts and extraverts and provide conscious consideration toward behavioural adaptation amongst participants. Secondly, there is a need for adequate follow-up support to enable participants to continue to learn from their experience, whilst also mitigating any potential risk toward long-term trauma caused by such deeply personal experiences. Finally, where assessment and reward form an output from any Centre, judgement should be limited until a thorough de-brief has been undertaken with the participant to explore causal behavioural responses, as opposed to basing decisions on observed behaviour alone.
How Motivated are You? Exploring the Differences Between Motivational Profiles and Personality Traits	Motivation is vital for performance and encompasses a range of processes and desires (Maslow 1970; Beck 1983; Wentzel 1999). These desires stimulate an action or behaviour, caused and directed by motives where the individual identifies and prioritises goals to be achieved (Deci and Ryan 2000, 2008; Roberts et al. 2004).   This study investigated motivation between different sports personality types using a cross sectional design. Participants (n=239), who regularly participated in sports sessions, completed the Sport Motivation Scale (SMS; Pelletier et al. 1995) and an adapted Eysenck Personality Inventory (EPI; Eysenck and Eysenck 1964). Results showed that extroverted athletes reported significantly higher intrinsic motivation (IM) than introverted athletes (p = .006) more specifically this was IM-to accomplish (p = .029) and IM-to experience stimulation (p = .001). Athletes high in neuroticism showed significantly more amotivation than their more stable counterparts (p = .001). The findings suggest that some sports participants can experience neuroticism which is also related to high levels of amotivation. Extroverted athletes may focus on utilising both intrinsic and extrinsic motives, in line with Roberts et al. (2004), resulting in higher levels of overall motivation for this study. Introverted athletes showed less intrinsic motivation than expected which may demonstrate a conflict between the internal focus of the introvert and the extrinsic nature of sport as discussed by Hong and O’Neil (2001) and Pushkar et al. (2002).
Meridian Masterclass: The Bladder Meridian	This article describes the path and anatomy of the Bladder meridian.  It explores points commonly used by Physiotherapists, unravelling the rationale behind their indications from both a Western and traditional Chinese perspective.  The concept of back-shu points is analysed and key safety considerations are highlighted. This masterclass draws on current research to highlight parallels between Western medical and traditional Chinese philosophies.
I Must Do the Post - Using Poetry for Raising Dementia Awareness	This paper reviews the use of a poem written by a care assistant as part of a dementia awareness course. the author of the poem went on to use the poem to help staff within the care home gain an insight and to promote reflection and discussion about caring for the person living with dementia as part of a training programme. an evaluation of its use was a also undertaken and staff reported that this poem was thought provoking, insightful and had helped them to reflect on how they work with people living with dementia.
Phenotypic Association Analyses with Copy Number Variation in Recurrent Depressive Disorder	BACKGROUND:  Defining the molecular genomic basis of the likelihood of developing depressive disorder is a considerable challenge. We previously associated rare, exonic deletion copy number variants (CNV) with recurrent depressive disorder (RDD). Sex chromosome abnormalities also have been observed to co-occur with RDD.  METHODS:  In this reanalysis of our RDD dataset (N = 3106 cases; 459 screened control samples and 2699 population control samples), we further investigated the role of larger CNVs and chromosomal abnormalities in RDD and performed association analyses with clinical data derived from this dataset.  RESULTS:  We found an enrichment of Turner's syndrome among cases of depression compared with the frequency observed in a large population sample (N = 34,910) of live-born infants collected in Denmark (two-sided p = .023, odds ratio = 7.76 [95% confidence interval = 1.79-33.6]), a case of diploid/triploid mosaicism, and several cases of uniparental isodisomy. In contrast to our previous analysis, large deletion CNVs were no more frequent in cases than control samples, although deletion CNVs in cases contained more genes than control samples (two-sided p = .0002).  CONCLUSIONS:  After statistical correction for multiple comparisons, our data do not support a substantial role for CNVs in RDD, although (as has been observed in similar samples) occasional cases may harbor large variants with etiological significance. Genetic pleiotropy and sample heterogeneity suggest that very large sample sizes are required to study conclusively the role of genetic variation in mood disorders.
Factors Influencing Post-exercise Plasma Protein Carbonyl Concentration	Exercise of sufficient intensity and duration can cause acute oxidative stress. Plasma protein  carbonyl (PC) moieties are abundant, chemically stable, and easily detectable markers of oxidative  stress that are widely used for the interpretation of exercise-induced changes in redox balance.  Despite many studies reporting acute increases in plasma PC concentration in response to exercise,  some studies, including those from our own laboratory have shown decreases. This review will  discuss the differences between studies reporting increases, decreases, and no change in plasma  PC concentration following exercise in humans; highlighting participant physiology (i.e. training  status) and study design (i.e. intensity, duration, and novelty of the exercise bout) as the main  factors driving the direction of the PC response to exercise. The role of the 20S proteasome system  is proposed as a possible mechanism mediating the clearance of plasma PC following exercise.  Resting and exercise-induced differences in plasma protein composition and balance between  tissues are also discussed. We suggest that exercise may stimulate the clearance of plasma PC  present at baseline, whereas simultaneously increasing reactive oxygen species production that  facilitates the formation of new PC groups. The balance between these two processes likely  explains why some studies have reported no change or even decreases in plasma PC level postexercise  when other biomarkers of oxidative stress (e.g. markers of lipid peroxidation) were  elevated. Future studies should determine factors that influence the balance between PC clearance  and formation following acute exercise.
Future Air Quality Related Health Effects in Europe and the Nordic Region—Sensitivity to Changes in Climate, Anthropogenic Emissions, Demography and Building Stock	Future changes in population exposures to ambient air pollution are inherently linked with long-term trends in outdoor air quality, but also with changes in the building stock. Moreover, the burden of disease is further driven by the ageing of the European populations. This study aims to assess the impact of changes in climate, emissions, building stocks and population on air pollution related human health impacts across Europe in the future. Therefore an integrated assessment model combining atmospheric models and health impacts has been setup for projections of the future developments in air pollution related premature mortality. The focus is here on the regional scale impacts of exposure to surface ozone (O3), Secondary Inorganic Aerosols (SIA) and primary particulate matter (PPM).
Using a Dynamical Approach for Implementing Ammonia Emissions into WRF-Chem Over Europe	This paper presents the influence of an emission approach applied (fixed and dynamical) on calculated ammonia concentration and model performance. We simulated with the WRF-Chem model a winter (January) and an early spring period (March) of 2012 for the entire Europe. Regardless of a relatively coarse resolution (36 km x 36 km) of the WRF-Chem simulations and the Europe-wide default settings applied in the dynamic ammonia model, the modelled concentrations are improved significantly by applying a dynamical emission instead of using a fixed emission profile.
Application of the WRF-Chem Model For Air Pollution Forecasting in Poland	This paper presents the first step in the development of a forecasting system for air pollution concentrations for the south-west region of Poland. We simulated a winter (January) and a summer (July) period of 2014 with WRF-Chem. The focus has been on studying different chemical options during the two simulation periods, therefore keeping emissions constant, except for natural sources. The authors have found that different model setups increase model performance for gases and particulate matter and that there is no clear dependence between forecast lead time and model performance.
Visualising Spaces: The Illustrated Map as a Mode of Communicating Fact, Fiction and Feeling	Communicating thoughts, facts and narratives through visual devices such as allegory or symbolism was fundamental to early map making and this remains the case with contemporary illustration. Drawing was employed then as a way of describing historic narratives (fact and folklore) through the convenience of a drawn symbol or character. The map creators were visionaries, depicting known discoveries and anticipating what existed beyond the agreed boundaries. As we now have photographic and virtual reality maps at our disposal, how can illustration develop the language of what a map is and can be?  How can we break the rules of map design and yet still communicate the idea of a sense of place with the aim to inform, excite and/or educate the ‘traveller’?      As Illustrators we need to question the purpose of creating a ‘map’: what do we want to communicate and is representational image making the only way to present information of a location? Is creating a more personal interpretation a form of cartouche, reminiscent of elements within the Hereford Mappa Mundi and maps of Blaeu, and can this improve/hinder the communicative aspect of the map? Looking at a variety of historical and contemporary illustrated maps and artists (such as Grayson Perry), who track their journeys through drawing, both conventional journeys and emotional, I will aim to prove that the illustrated map is not mere decoration but is a visual language providing an allegorical response to tangible places and personal feelings.
Social Enterprise	The article aims to introduce an exercise template, objectives identified.   • To understand and be able to define Social Enterprise  • To explore the business models used within Social Enterprise  • To understand the cross-sector theories of Social Enterprise  • Identity popular companies with the health sector and discuss their business models
The Impact of Victim Advocacy on the Prosecution of Domestic Violence Offences: Lessons from a Realistic Evaluation	This article explores the impact of a court-based advocacy service on the prosecution of domestic violence offences.  The research, conducted as part of a PhD thesis, evaluated a team of Independent Domestic Violence Advisors (IDVAs) based within a Specialist Domestic Violence Court (SDVC).  The author adopted the methodology of Realistic Evaluation (Pawson and Tilley, 1997) in order to understand firstly, any impact of the court-based IDVA service on court outcomes, secondly, how any such outcomes were achieved and, finally, in what contexts they occurred.  As this article explores, effective victim advocacy has the potential to impact positively on the prosecution of domestic violence offences.
Development of the Student Evidence-based Practice Questionnaire (S-EBPQ)	Background  The assessment of learning and teaching of Evidence-based Practice (EBP) in nursing is an important issue, yet few tools have been developed specifically for use with student nurses. Therefore, the Evidence-based Practice Questionnaire (EBPQ), which has been successfully used to measure EBP in nurses and nurse educators, was revised to develop a Student version (S-EBPQ).    Objective  The purpose of the study was to develop a student version of the Evidence-based Practice Questionnaire (EBPQ) and test its psychometric properties with a UK undergraduate student population.    Design  Instrument development study.    Participants and Method  Two hundred and forty-four undergraduate nursing students from an English University were recruited over a three year period to complete the EBPQ. This data was submitted to reliability analysis based on Item Response Theory and Exploratory Factor Analysis to explore construct validity.    Results  Principal Component Analysis demonstrated evidence for the S-EBPQ's construct validity, and analyses comparing the subscale scores of students in their first and second years of studies identified evidence for the tool's convergent validity. Descriptive statistics, correlation coefficients and reliability estimates demonstrated evidence for the S-EBPQ's internal reliability, and item facility and discrimination.    Conclusion  The S-EBPQ appears to be a psychometrically robust measure of EBP use, attitudes, and knowledge and skills (regarding the retrieval and evaluation of evidence, and the application and sharing of EBP). It may therefore provide an effective means of evaluating learning of EBP with undergraduate nursing students.
Determination of the Maximum Rate of Eccrine Sweat Glands’ Ion Reabsorption Using the Galvanic Skin Conductance to Local Sweat Rate Relationship	Purpose The purpose of the present study was to develop and describe a simple method to evaluate the rate of ion reabsorption of eccrine sweat glands in human using the measurement of galvanic skin conductance (GSC) and local sweating rate (SR). This purpose was investigated by comparing the SR threshold for increasing GSC with following two criteria of sweat ion reabsorption in earlier studies such as 1) the SR threshold for increasing sweat ion was at approximately 0.2 to 0.5 mg/cm2/min and 2) exercise-heat acclimation improved the sweat ion reabsorption ability and would increase the criteria 1.  Methods Seven healthy non-heat-acclimated male subjects received passive heat treatment both before and after 7 days of cycling in hot conditions (50% maximum oxygen uptake, 60 min/day, ambient temperature 32°C, and 50% relative humidity).   Results Subjects became partially heat-acclimated, as evidenced by the decreased end-exercise heart rate (p<0.01), rate of perceived exhaustion (p<0.01), and oesophageal temperature (p=0.07), without alterations in whole-body sweat loss, from the first to the last day of training. As hypothesised, we confirmed that the SR threshold for increasing GSC was near the predicted SR during passive heating before exercise heat acclimation, and increased significantly after training (0.19 ± 0.09 to 0.32 ± 0.10 mg/cm2/min, p<0.05).   Conclusions The reproducibility of sweat ion reabsorption by the eccrine glands in the present study suggests that the relationship between GSC and SR can serve as a new index for assessing the maximum rate of sweat ion reabsorption of eccrine sweat glands in humans.
Validity and Test –retest Reliability of the TIVRE-Basket® Test for the Determination of Aerobic Power in Elite Male Basketball Players	The aims of this study were to 1) determine the relationship between performance on the court-based TIVRE-Basket® test and peak aerobic power determined from a criterion lab-based incremental treadmill test and 2) to examine the test-retest reliability of the TIVRE-Basket® test in elite male basketball players. To address aim 1, 36 elite male basketball players (age 25.2 + 4.7 years, weight 94.1 + 11.4 kg, height 195.83 + 9.6 cm) completed a graded treadmill exercise test and the TIVRE-Basket® within 72 hours. Mean distance recorded during the TIVRE-Basket® test was 4001.8 + 176.4m, and mean VO2 peak was 54.7 + 2.8 ml.kg.min-1, and the correlation between the two parameters was r=0.824 (P= <0.001).  Linear regression analysis identified TIVRE-Basket® distance (m) as the only unique predictor of VO2 peak in a single variable plus constant model: VO2 peak = 2.595 + ((0.13* TIVRE-Basket® distance (m)).  Performance on the TIVRE-Basket® test accounted for 67.8% of the variance in VO2 peak (t=8.466, P=<.001, 95% CI 0.01 - 0.016, SEE 1.61).  To address aim 2, 20 male basketball players (age 26.7±4.2; height 1.94±0.92; weight 94.0±9.1) performed the TIVRE-Basket® test on two occasions. There was no significant difference in total distance covered between Trial 1 (4138.8 + 677.3m) and Trial 2 (4188.0 + 648.8m; t = 0.5798, P = 0.5688). Mean difference between trials was 49.2 + 399.5m, with an ICC of 0.85 suggesting a moderate level of reliability. Standardised TEM was 0.88%, representing a moderate degree of trial to trial error, and the CV was 6.3%.  The TIVRE-Basket® test therefore represents a valid and moderately reliable court-based sport-specific test of aerobic power for use with individuals and teams of elite level male basketball players.  Future research is required to ascertain its validity and reliability in other basketball populations e.g. across age groups, at different levels of competition, in females and in different forms of the game e.g. wheelchair basketball.
The Impact of Thought Speed and Variability on Psychological State and Threat Perception: Further Exploration of the Theory of Mental Motion	Thought speed and variability are purportedly common features of specific psychological states, such as mania and anxiety. The present study explored the independent and combinational influence of these variables upon condition-specific symptoms and affective state, as proposed by Pronin and Jacobs’ (Perspect Psychol Sci, 3:461–485, 2008) theory of mental motion. A general population sample was recruited online (N = 263). Participants completed a thought speed and variability manipulation task, inducing a combination of fast/slow and varied/repetitive thought. Change in mania and anxiety symptoms was assessed through direct self-reported symptom levels and indirect, processing bias assessment (threat interpretation). Results indicated that fast and varied thought independently increased self-reported mania symptoms. Affect was significantly less positive and more negative during slow thought. No change in anxiety symptoms or threat interpretation was found between manipulation conditions. No evidence for the proposed combinational influence of speed and variability was found. Implications and avenues for therapeutic intervention are discussed.
Affective Instability, Childhood Trauma and Major Affective Disorders	BACKGROUND:  Affective instability (AI), childhood trauma, and mental illness are linked, but evidence in affective disorders is limited, despite both AI and childhood trauma being associated with poorer outcomes. Aims were to compare AI levels in bipolar disorder I (BPI) and II (BPII), and major depressive disorder recurrent (MDDR), and to examine the association of AI and childhood trauma within each diagnostic group.  METHODS:  AI, measured using the Affective Lability Scale (ALS), was compared between people with DSM-IV BPI (n=923), BPII (n=363) and MDDR (n=207) accounting for confounders and current mood. Regression modelling was used to examine the association between AI and childhood traumas in each diagnostic group.  RESULTS:  ALS scores in descending order were BPII, BPI, MDDR, and differences between groups were significant (p<0.05). Within the BPI group any childhood abuse (p=0.021), childhood physical abuse (p=0.003) and the death of a close friend in childhood (p=0.002) were significantly associated with higher ALS score but no association was found between childhood trauma and AI in BPII and MDDR.  LIMITATIONS:  The ALS is a self-report scale and is subject to retrospective recall bias.  CONCLUSIONS:  AI is an important dimension in bipolar disorder independent of current mood state. There is a strong link between childhood traumatic events and AI levels in BPI and this may be one way in which exposure and disorder are linked. Clinical interventions targeting AI in people who have suffered significant childhood trauma could potentially change the clinical course of bipolar disorder.
The Glow of Unwork? Issues of Portrayal in Networked Learning Research	In this paper, we suggest that portrayal of research is often undervalued and seen as ‘unwork’ (Galloway, 2012). Portrayal is often seen as an issue that is relatively straight forward by qualitative researchers, and invariably refers to putting the findings of the study together with excerpts from participants and usually, but not always, some interpretation. It tends to be seen as the means by which the researcher has chosen to position people and their perspectives, and it is imbued with a sense of not only positioning but also a contextual painting of a person in a particular way. Yet there are an array of issues and challenges about what portrayal can or might mean in digital spaces. In this paper we argue that researching education in a digital age provides greater or different opportunities to represent and portray data differently and suggest that these ways are underutilised. For example, for many researchers legitimacy comes through the use of participants’ voices in the form of quotations. However, we argue that this stance towards plausibility and legitimacy is problematic and needs to be reconsidered in terms of understanding differences in types of portrayal, recognizing how researchers position themselves in relation to portrayal, and understanding decision-making in relation to portrayal. We suggest that there need to be new perspectives about portrayal and concept, and ideas are provided that offer a different view. Three key recommendations are made:  Portrayal should be reconceptualised as four overlapping concepts: mustering, folding, cartography, and portrayal. Adopting such an approach will enable audiences, researchers and other stakeholders to critique the assumptions that researchers on tour bring to portrayal and encourage reflexivity.  Researchers on tour should highlight the temporal, mutable and shifting nature of portrayed research findings, emphasising the need for continued and varied research to inform understanding.  There is a significant need for greater insight into the influence of portrayal, as well as the difference between representation and portrayal. Future studies should prioritise this, and ensure that portrayal is considered and critiqued from the outset.
Cyber Enigmas? Passive Detection and Pedagogical Agents: Can Students Spot the fake?	This paper presents a study that was undertaken to examine human interaction with a pedagogical agent and the passive and active detection of such agents within a synchronous, online environment. A pedagogical agent is a software application which can provide a human like interaction using a natural language interface. These may be familiar from the smartphone interfaces such as ‘Siri’ or ‘Cortana’, or the virtual online assistants found on some websites, such as ‘Anna’ on the Ikea website. Pedagogical agents are characters on the computer screen with embodied life-like behaviours such as speech, emotions, locomotion, gestures, and movements of the head, the eye, or other parts of the body. The passive detection test is where participants are not primed to the potential presence of a pedagogical agent within the online environment. The active detection test is where participants are primed to the potential presence of a pedagogical agent. The purpose of the study was to examine how people passively detected pedagogical agents that were presenting themselves as humans in an online environment. In order to locate the pedagogical agent in a realistic higher education online environment, problem-based learning online was used. Problem-based learning online provides a focus for discussions and participation, without creating too much artificiality. The findings indicated that the ways in which students positioned the agent tended to influence the interaction between them. One of the key findings was that since the agent was focussed mainly on the pedagogical task this may have hampered interaction with the students, however some of its non-task dialogue did improve students' perceptions of the autonomous agents’ ability to interact with them. It is suggested that future studies explore the differences between the relationships and interactions of learner and pedagogical agent within authentic situations, in order to understand if students' interactions are different between real and virtual mentors in an online setting.
Cytomegalovirus Viral Load Within Blood Increases Markedly in Healthy People Over the Age of 70 Years	Background    Cytomegalovirus (CMV) is a highly prevalent herpesvirus, which maintains lifelong latency and places a significant burden on host immunity. Infection is associated with increased rates of vascular disease and overall mortality in the elderly and there is an urgent need for improved understanding of the viral-host balance during ageing.    CMV is extremely difficult to detect in healthy donors, however, using droplet digital PCR of DNA from peripheral blood monocytes, we obtained an absolute quantification of viral load in 44 healthy donors across a range of ages.      Results    Viral DNA was detected in 24 % (9/37) of donors below the age of 70 but was found in all individuals above this age. Furthermore, the mean CMV load was only 8.6 copies per 10,000 monocytes until approximately 70 years of age when it increased by almost 30 fold to 249 copies in older individuals (p < 0.0001). CMV was found within classical CD14+ monocytes and was not detectable within the CD14-CD16+ subset. The titre of CMV-specific IgG increased inexorably with age indicating that loss of humoral immunity is not a determinant of the increased viral load. In contrast, although cellular immunity to the structural late protein pp65 increased with age, the T cell response to the immediate early protein IE1 decreased in older donors.      Conclusion    These data reveal that effective control of CMV is impaired during healthy ageing, most probably due to loss of cellular control of early viral reactivation. This information will be of value in guiding efforts to reduce CMV-associated health complications in the elderly.
Comparing the Cultural Factors in the Sexual Exploitation of Young People in the UK and USA: Insights for Social Workers	Across both the UK and the USA, knowledge about the abuse of children and young people through sexual exploitation has developed rapidly over the past decade. Both countries have reached a consensus at the legislative level that victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE) are first and foremost victims of serious sexual forms of abuse. The perpetrators of CSE take advantage of economic, cognitive, social and emotional vulnerability to obtain sex. The exploitation frequently, but not exclusively, involves commercial gain and the presence of the victim’s ‘consent’ is no longer considered a vindication of such abuse. CSE is above all a cultural phenomenon. It begins with beliefs that normalise or deny the seriousness of the sexual exploitation taking place. This is true not only for the individuals directly involved but also relates to the attitudes held by some professionals. Positioning CSE as illegal and socially unacceptable has to occur not only at the legislative level but also in respect of professional agencies, communities, social networks and families. In practice, protecting young people from sexual exploitation is complex and the subjectivities within professional approaches need to be acknowledged. It is recommended that professionals across social services, policing, health and education receive core training to enable a consistently non discriminatory and research informed response to CSE. Social workers are well placed to lead and co ordinate such responses, particularly if there are adequate and effective resources in place. Providing a consistent and trustworthy therapeutic relationship is fundamental to the worker being able to work with a young person affected by CSE. Conclusions are that the domestic sexual exploitation and trafficking discourses developed in the UK and USA could be informative for other countries, such as those of Eastern Europe. Finally, the importance of sharing insights between countries is recommended to make us all better equipped to protect our young people from sexual exploitation and trafficking.
Copy Number Variation in Bipolar Disorder	Large (>100 kb), rare (<1% in the population) copy number variants (CNVs) have been shown to confer risk for schizophrenia (SZ), but the findings for bipolar disorder (BD) are less clear. In a new BD sample from the United Kingdom (n=2591), we have examined the occurrence of CNVs and compared this with previously reported samples of 6882 SZ and 8842 control subjects. When combined with previous data, we find evidence for a contribution to BD for three SZ-associated CNV loci: duplications at 1q21.1 (P=0.022), deletions at 3q29 (P=0.03) and duplications at 16p11.2 (P=2.3 × 10-4). The latter survives multiple-testing correction for the number of recurrent large CNV loci in the genome. Genes in 20 regions (total of 55 genes) were enriched for rare exonic CNVs among BD cases, but none of these survives correction for multiple testing. Finally, our data provide strong support for the hypothesis of a lesser contribution of very large (>500 kb) CNVs in BD compared with SZ, most notably for deletions >1 Mb (P=9 × 10-4).
“Cooling the Mark Out”: Experienced Teaching Assistants’ Perceptions of Their Work in the Inclusion of Pupils With Special Educational Needs in Mainstream Secondary Schools	Experienced teaching assistants’ (TAs’) perceptions and constructions of their work in the inclusion of pupils with special educational needs (SEN) within mainstream secondary schools are the focus of this study. In a field where much research has focussed on the technicist (TA characteristics and deployment), exploration of “inclusion” and of power relationships is prioritised. Elements of critical discourse analysis (CDA) are used to examine the words of TAs talking about their work. A simple CDA framework was produced, based on the work of others, piloted, and then used to analyse interview data from eight TAs who have extensive experience and degree qualifications. TAs report prioritising discretion, even imperceptibility, in class as they actively stay “under the radar” of teachers and schools. A divide within the mainstream schools between “the mainstream” and SEN resourced “base” seems apparent to the TAs, whether the support base is geographically separated or not. “Inclusion” is actively sought, for example through advocacy, alternative provision and energetic deployment of professional strategies. Insights from the work of Goffman are deployed in the analysis of the TAs’ perceptions in order to contribute theoretical imagination to consider why the limitations in TA practice (reported within this study and within the wider literature) may occur. A degree of emotional labour is indicated but Goffman’s work on managing spoiled identity, stigma and “cooling” is of interest in offering possible explanations for the TAs’ experiences.
A Video Analysis of Intra- and Inter-professional Leadership Behaviours Within “The Burns Suite”: Identifying Key Leadership Models	Objective    Leadership is particularly important in complex highly interprofessional health care contexts involving a number of staff, some from the same specialty (intraprofessional), and others from different specialties (interprofessional). The authors recently published the concept of “The Burns Suite” (TBS) as a novel simulation tool to deliver interprofessional and teamwork training. It is unclear which leadership behaviors are the most important in an interprofessional burns resuscitation scenario, and whether they can be modeled on to current leadership theory. The purpose of this study was to perform a comprehensive video analysis of leadership behaviors within TBS.  Methods    A total of 3 burns resuscitation simulations within TBS were recorded. The video analysis was grounded-theory inspired. Using predefined criteria, actions/interactions deemed as leadership behaviors were identified. Using an inductive iterative process, 8 main leadership behaviors were identified. Cohen’s κ coefficient was used to measure inter-rater agreement and calculated as κ = 0.7 (substantial agreement). Each video was watched 4 times, focusing on 1 of the 4 team members per viewing (senior surgeon, senior nurse, trainee surgeon, and trainee nurse). The frequency and types of leadership behavior of each of the 4 team members were recorded. Statistical significance to assess any differences was assessed using analysis of variance, whereby a p < 0.05 was taken to be significant. Leadership behaviors were triangulated with verbal cues and actions from the videos.  Results    All 3 scenarios were successfully completed. The mean scenario length was 22 minutes. A total of 362 leadership behaviors were recorded from the 12 participants. The most evident leadership behaviors of all team members were adhering to guidelines (which effectively equates to following Advanced Trauma and Life Support/Emergency Management of Severe Burns resuscitation guidelines and hence “maintaining standards”), followed by making decisions. Although in terms of total frequency the senior surgeon engaged in more leadership behaviors compared with the entire team, statistically there was no significant difference between all 4 members within the 8 leadership categories. This analysis highlights that “distributed leadership” was predominant, whereby leadership was “distributed” or “shared” among team members. The leadership behaviors within TBS also seemed to fall in line with the “direction, alignment, and commitment” ontology.  Conclusions    Effective leadership is essential for successful functioning of work teams and accomplishment of task goals. As the resuscitation of a patient with major burns is a dynamic event, team leaders require flexibility in their leadership behaviors to effectively adapt to changing situations. Understanding leadership behaviors of different team members within an authentic simulation can identify important behaviors required to optimize nontechnical skills in a major resuscitation. Furthermore, attempting to map these behaviors on to leadership models can help further our understanding of leadership theory. Collectively this can aid the development of refined simulation scenarios for team members, and can be extrapolated into other areas of simulation-based team training and interprofessional education.

Bridging the Divide in Work and Occupational Psychology: Evidence From Practice	This study explores the extent to which work and organizational (W&O) psychology practitioners use evidence, how they apply it to the everyday contexts in which they work and the types of barriers they encounter in so doing. It adopts a mixed methods approach involving the administration of a survey to a UK sample (N=163) of W&O psychologists and a series of semi-structured interviews (N=25) exploring in greater depth how evidence is applied in practice. Findings reveal that practitioners consult a wide range of different types of evidence which they employ at various stages of engagement with client organisations and that this evidence is pressed into service in the pursuit of solutions which are both acceptable from the client perspective and consistent with the scientific standards underpinning professional knowledge and expertise in W&O psychology. Barriers to evidence-use were mainly practical in nature, concerning issues around managing the client-consultant relationship and the particularities of implementation context, both of which were shown to influence evidence utilisation. The study contributes to current debate on the extent to which W&O psychologists adopt an evidence-based approach and provides a valuable and much called-for empirical insight into the enactment of the scientist-practitioner model in W&O psychology
Carers and Co-Production: Enabling Expertise through Experience?	Purpose  To provide a brief overview of the literature to date which has focussed on co-production within mental healthcare in the UK, including service user and carer involvement and collaboration.      Design  The paper presents key outcomes from studies which have explicitly attempted to introduce co-produced care in addition to specific tools designed to encourage co-production within mental health services.  The paper debates the cultural and ideological shift required for staff, service users and family members to undertake co-produced care and outlines challenges ahead with respect to service redesign and new roles in practice.      Findings  Informal carers (family and friends) are recognised as a fundamental resource for mental health service provision, as well as a rich source of expertise through experience, yet their views are rarely solicited by mental health professionals or taken into account during decision-making.   This issue is considered alongside new policy recommendations which advocate the development of co-produced services and care.    Research Limitations  Despite the launch of a number of initiatives designed to build on peer experience and support, there has been a lack of attention on the differing dynamic which remains evident between healthcare professionals and people using mental health services.  Co-production sheds a light on the blurring of roles, trust and shared endeavour (Slay and Stephens, 2013) but, despite an increase in peer recovery workers across England, there has been little research or service development designed to focus explicitly on this particular dynamic.    Practical Implications  Despite these challenges, coproduction in mental healthcare represents a real opportunity for the skills and experience of family members to be taken into account and could provide a mechanism to achieve the ‘triangle of care’ with input, recognition and respect given to all (service users, carers, professionals) whose lives are touched by mental distress.  However, lack of attention in relation to carer perspectives, expertise and potential involvement could undermine the potential for coproduction to act as a vehicle to encourage person-centred care which accounts for social in addition to clinical factors.    Social Implications  The families of people with severe and enduring mental illness (SMI) assume a major responsibility for the provision of care and support to their relatives over extended time periods (Rose et al, 2004).  Involving carers in discussions about care planning could help to provide a wider picture about the impact of mental health difficulties, beyond symptom reduction.  The ‘co-production of care’ reflects a desire to work meaningfully and fully with service users and carers.  However, to date, little work has been undertaken in order to coproduce services through the ‘triangle of care’ with carers bringing their own skills, resources and expertise.     Originality/Value  This paper debates the current involvement of carers across mental healthcare and debates whether co-production could be a vehicle to utilise carer expertise, enhance quality and satisfaction with mental healthcare.   The critique of current work highlights the danger of increasing expectations on service providers to undertake work aligned to key initiatives (shared decision-making, person-centred care, co-production), that have common underpinning principles but, in the absence of practical guidance, could be addressed in isolation rather than as an integrated approach within a ‘triangle of care’.
Applied Sport Psychology: An Expert Panel Discussion.	An interview with several exercise and sport scientists including Andrea Faull, Kate Hays, Stephen D. Mellaliue, and Brendan Cropley in Great Britain is presented. They share how their practice philosophy was developed over time. They share advice to those who started working in the field. They also reveal the interventions they have implemented in the practice.
A Practical Approach to Using Motion Capture in Performance Dance	Markerless systems are becoming more ubiquitous due to their increased use in video games consoles. Cheap cameras and software suites are making motion capture technologies more freely available to the digitally inclined choreographer. In this workshop we will demonstrate the opportunities and limitations provided by easily accessible and relatively inexpensive markerless motion capture systems. In particular we will explore the capacity of these systems to provide useful data in a live performance scenario where the latency, size and format of the captured data is crucial in allowing real-time processing and visualisation of the captured scene
A Global Portrait of Counselling Psychologists’ Characteristics, Perspectives, and Professional Behaviors	Counselling psychologists in eight countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa,  South Korea, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States) responded to survey questions  that focused on their demographics as well as their professional identities, roles, settings and  activities. As well, they were asked about satisfaction with the specialty and the extent to which  they endorsed 10 core counselling psychology values. This article reports those results, focusing  both on areas in which there were between-country similarities as well as on those for which  there were differences. These data provide is a snapshot of counselling psychology globally and  establish a foundation for the other articles in this special issue of the journal.
Mental Toughness Moderates Social Loafing in  Cycle Time-Trial Performance	Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine if mental toughness moderated the occurrence of social loafing in cycle time-trial performance. Method: Twenty-seven men (Mage = 17.7 years, SD = 0.6) completed the Sport Mental Toughness Questionnaire prior to completing a 1-min cycling trial under 2 conditions: once with individual performance identified, and once in a group with individual performance not identified. Using a median split of the mental toughness index, participants were divided into high and low mental toughness groups. Cycling distance was compared using a 2 (trial) × 2 (high–low mental toughness) analysis of variance. We hypothesized that mentally tough participants would perform equally well under both conditions (i.e., no indication of social loafing) compared with low mentally tough participants, who would perform less well when their individual performance was not identifiable (i.e., demonstrating the anticipated social loafing effect). Results: The high mental toughness group demonstrated consistent performance across both conditions, while the low mental toughness group reduced their effort in the non-individually identifiable team condition. Conclusions: The results confirm that (a) clearly identifying individual effort/performance is an important situational variable that may impact team performance and (b) higher perceived mental toughness has the ability to negate the tendency to loaf.
A Critical Discussion Upon the Relationship Between the Psychoanalytical Perspective of Developmental Psychology and its Adaptation to Educating Teenage Mothers	This paper will critically explore elements of the psychoanalytic paradigm of developmental psychology in relation to the professional practice of working with teenage mothers in an educational setting.     Particular focus will be given to the psychosexual and psychosocial staged theories of development. The framework for this critical analysis will examine each stage of psychosexual and psychosocial theory in relation to teenage motherhood. These perspectives have been specifically chosen due to the explicit links between staged childhood experience and adult behaviour in relation to sexual and social aspects of development, both aspects having fundamental links to teenage parenthood.     Four case study examples are used to demonstrate how psychoanalytical theory may relate to this cohort. These are taken from the author’s past professional work as a teenage parent programme lead. The examples are given to shed light on the impact of each psychosocial and psychosexual stage of development.    This article concludes that whilst both the psychosocial and psychosexual models of development are useful in giving educators a perspective into behaviours that are displayed in adolescence, they are but one of many perspectives that should be taken into account when working with this cohort.
Rhetoric and Realities of London 2012 Olympic Education and Participation ‘Legacies’: Voices from the Core and Periphery	A legacy emphasis was one of the fundamental pillars of the London 2012 Olympic Games. The notion of an Olympic legacy was predicated on assumptions that the event’s value would not purely derive from the sporting spectacle, but rather, from the ‘success’ of enduring effects met out in London and across the country. For physical education students and practitioners, Olympic legacy agendas translated into persistent pressure to increase inspiration, engagement, participation and performance in the subject, sport and physical activity. Responding to this context, and cogniscent of significant disciplinary scholarship, this paper reports initial data from the first phase of a longitudinal study involving Key Stage Three (students aged 11-13) cohorts in two comparable United Kingdom schools: the first an inner-city (core) London school adjacent to the Olympic Park in Stratford, East London (n=150); the second, a (peripheral) school in the Midlands (n=198). The research involved the use of themed questionnaires focusing on self-reported attitudes toward the Olympic Games, and, experiences of physical education, sport and physical activity. Students from both schools demonstrated a wide variety of attitudes toward physical education and sport; yet, minor variances emerged regarding extreme enthusiasm levels. Both cohorts also expressed considerably mixed feelings toward the impending Olympic Games. Strong and variable responses were also reported regarding inspiration levels, ticketing acquisition and engagement levels. Consequently, this investigation can be read within the broader context of legacy debates, and, aligns well with physical educationalists’ on-going discomfort regarding legacy imperatives being enforced upon the discipline and its practitioners. Our work reiterates a shared disciplinary scepticism that while an Olympic Games may temporarily affect young peoples’ affectations for sport (and maybe physical education and physical activity), it may not provide the best, or most appropriate, mechanism for sustained attitudinal and/or social changes en masse.
Combinative Aspects of Leadership Style and Emotional Intelligence	Purpose  – The purpose of this paper is to examine whether the leader’s emotional intelligence influences the leader’s preferences for different ways of combining leadership behaviors (i.e. combinative aspects of leadership style).    Design/methodology/approach  – The authors used a hybrid design to collect the data to avoid common-method biases. The authors described a high-stress workplace in a vignette and asked participants to rank four styles of combining a task-oriented leadership (i.e. Pressure) statement and a socio-emotional leadership (i.e. Support) statement. The authors then asked participants to complete a Likert-scale based questionnaire on emotional intelligence.    Findings  – The authors found that leaders who prefer to provide Support immediately before Pressure have higher levels of emotional intelligence than do leaders who prefer the three other combinative styles. Leaders who prefer to provide Pressure and Support separately (i.e. provide Pressure 30 minutes after Support) have the lowest levels of emotional intelligence.    Research limitations/implications  – A key implicit assumption in the work is that leaders do not want to evoke negative emotions in followers. The authors did not take into account factors that influence leadership style which participating managers would be likely to encounter on a daily basis such as the relationship with the follower, the follower’s level of performance and work experience, the gender of the leader and the gender of the follower, the hierarchical levels of the leader and follower, and the followers’ preferred combinative style. The nature of the sample and the use of a hypothetical scenario are other limitations of the study.    Practical implications  – Providing leadership behaviors that are regarded as effective is necessary but not enough because the emotional impact of leadership behaviors appears to also depend on how the behaviors are configured.    Originality/value  – This is the first study to show that the emotional intelligence of leaders is related to their preferences for the manner in which they combine task and social leadership statements. Furthermore, two-factor theories of leadership propose that the effects of task and social leadership are additive. However, the findings show that the effects are interactive.
Responding to Fluctuating Demand for Healthcare Services	The level of demand for healthcare services can fluctuate quite strongly. Indeed, some parts of the healthcare service are renowned for having peaks of demand which challenge capacity. Dealing with fluctuations in demand is a common problem in many service industries. This article examines some of the strategies available for influencing the level of demand, including the use of price, communications and demand analysis. The article also outlines a wide variety of ways in which patients can be encouraged to be more tolerant of waiting to receive service from healthcare professionals. In particular, eight principles of waiting are discussed and illustrated in the context of healthcare services.
The Professionalisation of Non-Denominational Religious Education in England: Politics, Organisation and Knowledge	In response to contemporary concerns, and using neglected primary sources, this article explores the professionalisation of teachers of Religious Education (RI/RE) in non-denominational, state-maintained schools in England. It does so from the launch of Religion in Education (1934) and the Institute for Christian Education at Home and Abroad (1935) to the founding of the Religious Education Council of England and Wales (1973) and the British Journal of Religious Education (1978). Professionalisation is defined as a collective historical process in terms of three inter-related concepts: (1) professional self-organisation and professional politics, (2) professional knowledge, and (3) initial and continuing professional development. The article sketches the history of non-denominational religious education prior to the focus period, to contextualise the emergence of the professionalising processes under scrutiny. Professional self-organisation and professional politics are explored by reconstructing the origins and history of the Institute of Christian Education at Home and Abroad, which became the principal body offering professional development provision for RI/RE teachers for some fifty years. Professional knowledge is discussed in relation to the content of Religion in Education which was oriented around Christian Idealism and interdenominational networking. Changes in journal name in the 1960s and 1970s reflected uncertainties about the orientation of the subject and shifts in understanding over the nature and character of professional knowledge. The article also explores a particular case of resistance, in the late 1960s, to the prevailing consensus surrounding the nature and purpose of RI/RE, and the representativeness and authority of the pre-eminent professional body of the time. In conclusion, the article examines some implications which may be drawn from this history for the prospects and problems of the professionalisation of RE today.
Students as Partners in Recruitment	Students are rarely involved in the recruitment of professional library staff, despite being a key group that such staff interact with.  This article outlines a new approach at Library Services at The Hive at the University of Worcester; students are now routinely invited to join work related exercise panels as part of the recruitment process.   This collaborative approach means that students not only get a say in their library staff and feel more of a sense of ownership of library services, but also have a valuable experience to use on their CVs and to inform their own job applications and interviews.  This article details the role of students in these activities, the response from staff, and plans to improve the process further.
Wearing Eye Tracking Technology During Batting Practice: Assessing the Experiences of Professional Baseball Athletes	Utilizing wearable technology in sport allows for the collection of motor behavior data during task engagement. This data can be assessed in real-time or retrospectively. Although enriching the scope of performance data, the consequences of wearable technology on the athlete-user, specifically the cognitive effects, has not been fully investigated, hence the purpose of this study.     This qualitative study examines the cognitions of 57 professional baseball players who wore eye tracking technology whilst engaged in batting practice. Their verbal self-reports were framed by temporal context: before-during-after task. Three themes emerged during the pre-task segment: social appearance anxiety, claimed self-handicapping, and curiosity. During the task of batting, verbal behavior contained motivational and instructional overt self-talk while claimed self-handicapping was sustained. The final, post-performance segment was marked by the re-emergence of curiosity from the pre-task period as well as self-evaluation/appraisal.     Given the participants were professional athletes, their performance has greater career implications than amateur competitors. Nonetheless, the verbal behavior elicited while wearing eye tracking technology indicates an awareness of the equipment by the user. This study found cognitive effects from wearable technology; more research is required to under-stand the scope and nature of those effects on cognitive and motor behaviors.
A Whole School Approach to Language Development in the Early Years: Professional Development in Action	This article presents findings from a staged evaluation of a three year longitudinal research project, now at the end of its second year, undertaken by the University of Worcester in collaboration with North Town Primary School, situated in Southern England. It uses an action research approach to foreground intervention strategies used to support children entering school with speech and language delay. Data collection took an interpretivist approach, acknowledging the diverse range of variables present in a child’s life, and sought to focus upon the lived experience of practitioners supporting children’s language development within the study school. The following paper reflects upon the impact of the project so far. It indicates a shift in culture at the school, with a greater emphasis and value being placed upon tools to support children’s language enrichment, recognizing the impact that these can have on a child’s confidence and independence. Conversely it also identifies some fundamental issues which remain; the most concerning being that the skills needed to support the development of children’s speech and language remain lacking within initial teacher training. It highlights the necessity for professional development within speech, language and communication to be fully acknowledged at policy level if we are to adequately cater for the needs of our children, especially those who are most vulnerable.
Genome-wide Association Study Identifies SESTD1 as a Novel Risk Gene for Lithium Responsive Bipolar Disorder	Lithium is the mainstay prophylactic treatment for bipolar disorder (BD), but treatment response varies considerably across individuals. Patients who respond well to lithium treatment might represent a relatively homogeneous subtype of this genetically and phenotypically diverse disorder. Here, we performed genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify (i) specific genetic variations influencing lithium response and (ii) genetic variants associated with risk for lithium-responsive BD. Patients with BD and controls were recruited from Sweden and the United Kingdom. GWAS were performed on 2698 patients with subjectively defined (self-reported) lithium response and 1176 patients with objectively defined (clinically documented) lithium response. We next conducted GWAS comparing lithium responders with healthy controls (1639 subjective responders and 8899 controls; 323 objective responders and 6684 controls). Meta-analyses of Swedish and UK results revealed no significant associations with lithium response within the bipolar subjects. However, when comparing lithium-responsive patients with controls, two imputed markers attained genome-wide significant associations, among which one was validated in confirmatory genotyping (rs116323614, P=2.74 × 10-8). It is an intronic single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) on chromosome 2q31.2 in the gene SEC14 and spectrin domains 1 (SESTD1), which encodes a protein involved in regulation of phospholipids. Phospholipids have been strongly implicated as lithium treatment targets. Furthermore, we estimated the proportion of variance for lithium-responsive BD explained by common variants ('SNP heritability') as 0.25 and 0.29 using two definitions of lithium response. Our results revealed a genetic variant in SESTD1 associated with risk for lithium-responsive BD, suggesting that the understanding of BD etiology could be furthered by focusing on this subtype of BD.
Exploring Coach Behaviours, Session Contexts and Key Stakeholder Perceptions of Non-linear Coaching Approaches in Youth Sport	Gaining better understanding of coaching pedagogies remains a crucial aspect of developing practice.  In particular, pedagogic strategies which do not follow transmission-based, technically-focused, approaches have been under-investigated.  Furthermore, most investigations into coaching processes have elicited an incomplete understanding of the respective pedagogies due to deficiencies in the methodology such as limited triangulation of methods.  This study utilises two systematic observation instruments, field notes, individual coach interviews and parent group interviews in order to investigate non-linear coaching pedagogies in three youth sport environments.  The systematic observation instruments revealed a lower rate of coach behaviour than has previously been reported alongside fewer technical interventions and more questioning.  The qualitative data revealed three themes; creating an environment of participant centredness, holistic development and authentically situated learning.  The methodology effectively elicited understanding of the coaches’ pedagogic strategies.  Future research should utilise such methodologies to investigate other sporting environments such as in elite and disability sport, particularly studying those approaches which feature non-linear pedagogies.
Filling the Gap? Romanian Social Workers’“Migration” Into the UK	The recent past decades have seen an increased transnational mobility among  internationally educated social workers. For example, the UK social work system has  seen an increased level of social workers recruited from abroad in certain fields of  practice, mainly due to the staff shortage. This opinion paper aims to draw attention to  the challenges faced by internationally qualified social workers in their efforts to integrate  and adapt their practice to the UK system, with a focus on Romanian social workers,  identified as a numerically significant group of ‘trained abroad’ social workers. The  paper also highlights the lack of research available to understand the factors contributing  to the social work professional immigration into the UK and is examining the connection  between professional acculturation and successful practice. The article aims to act as a  call for research and collaboration between social work providers and professional  regulatory bodies, both in Romania and UK, as well as employers in order to develop  focused research and practice guidance in this area.
Searching for a Trace of Artemisia Campestris Pollen in the Air	The aim of the study was to determinate whether Artemisia campestris was present in the vicinity of 8 pollen monitoring stations in Poland by examining temporal variations in daily average airborne Artemisia pollen data recorded by Hirst type volumetric traps. Three day moving averages of airborne Artemisia pollen were examined by Spearman’s rank correlation test. Results show that Artemisia pollen seasons in Poland generally display similar unimodal patterns (correlation coefficients r > 0.900; P < 0.05). The only exception was the Artemisia pollen concentration noted in the outskirts of Poznań (Morasko), where the bimodal pattern was revealed. Correlations between Artemisia pollen data recorded at Poznań-Morasko and the other Polish sites were the lowest in the investigated dataset; this was particularly noticeable in the second part of pollen season (r ~0.730). We show that the typical bimodal pattern in Artemisia pollen seasons, which is characteristic of the presence of both A. vulgaris (first peak) and A. campestris (second peak), does not occur at the majority of sites in Poland and is restricted to the outskirts of Poznań. In fact, it was noted that the pollen monitoring site in Poznań-Centre, just 8 km from Morasko, only exhibited one peak (attributed to A. vulgaris). This shows that the influence of A. campestris on airborne pollen season curves is limited and can be largely disregarded. In addition, this study supports previous records showing that the spatial distribution of airborne Artemisia pollen within a city (urban-rural gradient) can vary markedly, depending on the species composition.
Learning From Others	There is no doubt that teachers completing their initial teacher training year, or early into their career, have a difficult job trying to meet the needs of all children. This is not least because they are still developing a strong knowledge base and building upon new experiences while encountering continually high expectations of performance in their employing or training school. This article looks at what new teachers can learn from experienced colleagues about supporting children with Special Educational Needs.
Are we Doing Enough to Develop Career Competency?	How can you make sure that the graduates you employ are ‘career competent’? Are they prepared for your workplace when they arrive? How can you develop their competency?
Dementia Words Matter	NHS Fabstuff is a repository for examples of good practice. This short blog showcases work done by people living with dementia to highlight the negative impact of inappropriate language to describe people living with dementia.  The guide explains the words that people with dementia would like everyone to use when we talk to them and about them.
The Influence of Collective Behaviour on Pacing in Endurance Competitions	A number of theoretical models have been proposed to explain pacing strategies in individual competitive endurance events. These have typically related to internal regulatory processes informing the making of decisions relating to muscular work rate. Despite a substantial body of research investigating the influence of collective group dynamics on individual behaviours in various animal species, this issue has not been comprehensively studied in individual athletic events. This is surprising given that athletes directly compete in close proximity to one another, and that collective behaviour has also been observed in other human environments. Whilst reasons for adopting collective behaviour are not fully understood, it is thought to result from individual agents following simple local rules resulting in seemingly complex large systems acting to confer some biological advantage to the collective as a whole. Although such collective behaviours may generally be beneficial, endurance events are complicated by the fact that increasing levels of physiological disruption as activity progresses may compromise the ability of individuals to continue to interact with other group members. This could result in early fatigue and relative underperformance due to suboptimal utilisation of physiological resources by some athletes. Alternatively, engagement with a collective behaviour may benefit all due to a reduction in the complexity of decisions to be made and a subsequent reduction in cognitive loading and mental fatigue. This paper seeks evidence for collective behaviour in previously published analyses of pacing behaviour and proposes mechanisms through which it could potentially be either beneficial, or detrimental to individual performance.
Mapping Learning and Game Mechanics for Serious Games Analysis in Engineering Education	In a world where students are increasing digitally tethered to powerful, ‘always on’ mobile devices, new models of engagement and approaches to teaching and learning are required from educators. Serious Games (SG) have proved to have instructional potential but there is still a lack of methodologies and tools not only for their design but also to support game analysis and assessment. This paper explores the use of SG to increase student engagement and retention. The development phase of the Circuit Warz game is presented to demonstrate how electronic engineering education can be radically reimagined to create immersive, highly engaging learning experiences that are problem-centered and pedagogically sound. The Learning Mechanics–Game Mechanics (LM-GM) framework for SG game analysis is introduced and its practical use in an educational game design scenario is shown as a case study.
Employability and Students’ Part-time Work in the UK: Does Self-efficacy and Career Aspiration Matter?	Amid a growing focus on graduate employability, this study examines the relationship between students’  part-time work, career aspirations and self-efficacy, in a survey of 357 UK students from two  post-92 universities. The results suggest a positive and significant relationship between part-time  work and career aspiration. Students who work part-time, and value this opportunity, are likely to  have a high career aspiration and strive to enhance their employability agenda. Self-efficacy (students’  belief in their ability to succeed) is significantly associated with career aspiration. No significant  gender differences were found in our sample for all study variables. Finally, students’ level of  study and malleable self-theories (the belief that people are changeable and with effort can achieve  more) were found to be the strongest predictors of part-time work, while self-efficacy is the strongest  predictor of career aspiration. These findings confirm the importance of individual self-efficacy in  the value attached to part-time working among students in higher education (HE). Nonetheless,  those students who do not work part-time while studying, do so mainly because they do not want to  detract from their study. The concluding part of the paper discusses relevant application and policy  implications of these findings.
Is the Recent Decrease in Airborne Ambrosia Pollen in the Milan Area Due to the Accidental Introduction of the Ragweed Leaf Beetle Ophraella Communa?	This study aims to determine whether a significant decrease in airborne concentrations of Ambrosia pollen witnessed in the north-west of the Province of Milan in Northern Italy could be explained by environmental factors such as meteorology, or whether there is evidence to support the hypothesis that the decrease was related to the presence of large numbers of the oligophagous Ophraella communa leaf beetles that are used as a biological control agent against Ambrosia in other parts of the world. Airborne concentrations of Ambrosia, Cannabaceae and Urticaceae pollen data (2000–2013) were examined for trends over time and correlated with meteorological data. The amount of Ambrosia pollen recorded annually during the main flowering period of Ambrosia (August–September) was entered into linear regression models with meteorological data in order to determine whether the amount of airborne Ambrosia pollen recorded in 2013 was lower than would normally be expected based on the prevailing weather conditions. There were a number of significant correlations between concentrations of airborne Ambrosia, Cannabaceae and Urticaceae pollen, as well as between airborne pollen concentrations and daily and monthly meteorological data. The linear regression models greatly overestimated the amount of airborne Ambrosia pollen in 2013. The results of the regression analysis support the hypothesis that the observed decrease in airborne Ambrosia pollen may indeed be related to the presence of large numbers of O. communa in the Milan area, as the drastic decrease in airborne Ambrosia pollen in 2013 cannot be explained by meteorology alone.
Heart Failure and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease Multimorbidity at Hospital Discharge Transition: a Study of Patient and Carer Experience	Objectives: The main objective of our study was to explore the experiences of heart failure (HF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) multimorbid patients and their carers on hospital discharge. Secondary objectives included identification of gaps in the health care of multimorbidity and optimal solutions from patients and carers’ perspectives.  Methods: Mixed-methods were applied to collect data using patient self-completion questionnaire from an adopted version of the HCAHPS survey and in depth interviews. Participants were recruited from two cardiology and respiratory wards at a large regional hospital in England, and all had a multimorbidity diagnosis of COPD and HF.   Results: 14 out of 29 (48%) completed HCAHPS questionnaires were returned. Overall, nurses scored better (84%) than doctors (64%) in listening to patients. There were problems in communication about medication with 73% not aware of the reasons for new medication and 64% never been informed of their side effects.   In-depth interviews were carried out with 6 patients and 5 carers in the home setting one to two weeks following hospital discharge. Interviewees’ descriptions of their experiences on hospital discharge fell into four main themes: clarity of information, communication, continuity of care after discharge and issues with medication.   Conclusion: Our study showed that gaps and delays in communication between healthcare professionals and poor discharge documentation continue to be recurring issues in caring for patients with multimorbidity of HF and COPD. It further points to the need for a comprehensive, coordinated and integrated care that incorporates patients and carers preferences in order to improve the outcomes for multimorbidity.
Using Workload Measurement Tools in Diverse Care  Contexts: the Experience of Staff in Mental Health and  Learning Disability Inpatient Settings	Introduction  The critical challenge of determining the correct level and skill-mix of nursing staff required to deliver safe and effective healthcare has become an international concern.  It is recommended that evidence-based staffing decisions are central to the development of future workforce plans.  Workforce planning in mental health and learning disability nursing is largely under-researched with few tools available to aid the development of evidence-based staffing levels in these environments.      Aim  It was the aim of this study to explore the experience of staff using the Safer Nursing Care Tool (SNCT) and the Mental Health and Learning Disability Workload Tool (MHLDWT) in mental health and learning disability environments.           Method  Following a 4-week trial period of both tools a survey was distributed via Qualtrics on-line survey software to staff members who used the tools during this time.            Results  The results of the survey revealed that the tools were considered a useful resource to aid staffing decisions; however specific criticisms were highlighted regarding their suitability to psychiatric intensive care units (PICU) and learning disability wards.    Discussion  This study highlights that further development of workload measurement tools is required to support the implementation of effective workforce planning strategies within mental health and learning disability services.      Implications for Practice  With increasing fiscal pressures the need to provide cost-effective care is paramount within NHS services.  Evidence-based workforce planning is therefore necessary to ensure that appropriate levels of staff are determined.  This is of particular importance within mental health and learning disability services due to the reduction in the number of available beds and an increasing focus on purposeful admission and discharge.
Female Thermal Sensitivity to Hot and Cold During Rest and Exercise	Regional differences in thermal sensation to a hot or cold stimulus are often limited to male participants, in a rested state and cover minimal locations. Therefore, magnitude sensation to both a hot and cold stimulus were investigated during rest and exercise in 8 females (age: 20.4 ± 1.4 years, mass: 61.7 ± 4.0 kg, height: 166.9 ± 5.4 cm, VO2max: 36.8 ± 4.5 ml·kg− 1·min− 1). Using a repeated measures cross over design, participants rested in a stable environment (22.3 ± 0.9 °C, 37.7 ± 5.5% RH) whilst a thermal probe (25 cm2), set at either 40 °C or 20 °C, was applied in a balanced order to 29 locations across the body. Participants reported their thermal sensation after 10 s of application. Following this, participants cycled at 50% VO2max for 20 min and then 30% VO2max whilst the sensitivity test was repeated. Females experienced significantly stronger magnitude sensations to the cold than the hot stimulus (5.5 ± 1.7 and 4.3 ± 1.3, p < 0.05, respectively). A significant effect of location was found during the cold stimulation (p < 0.05). Thermal sensation was greatest at the head then the torso and declined towards the extremities. No significant effect of location was found in response to the hot stimulation and the pattern across the body was more homogenous. In comparison to rest, exercise caused a significant overall reduction in thermal sensation (5.2 ± 1.5 and 4.6 ± 1.7, respectively, p < 0.05). Body maps were produced for both stimuli during rest and exercise, which highlight sensitive areas across the body.
Critical Analysis of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Need	This paper intends to provide a critique of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Need, a psychological model that often goes unquestioned within the education sector. Examples will be given of the authors own professional practice and experience in relation to the Hierarchy of Need (HON) and discussed in terms of the critique. The paper concludes that whilst some elements of the HON may be useful in education it does have some serious flaws that also need to be considered when applying this to practice. This paper hopes to demonstrate that, quite often, the theoretical underpinning and research basis for theories that are widely used in education are neglected, highlighting that each planned action or perspective that may be used within education needs exploring in terms of context, evidence base and relevance.
Determination of Alternaria spp. Habitats Using 7-Day Volumetric Spore Trap, Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model and Geographic Information System	There are many species among the Alternaria genus, which hosts on economically important crops causing significant yield losses. Less attention has been paid to fungi hosting on plants constituting substantial components of pastures and meadows. Alternaria spp. spores are also recognised as important allergens.    A 7-day volumetric spore trap was used to monitor the concentration of airborne fungal spores. Air samples were collected in Worcester, England (2006–2010). Days with a high spore count were then selected. The longest episode that occurred within a five year study was chosen for modelling. Two source maps presenting distribution of crops under rotation and pastures in the UK were produced. Back trajectories were calculated using the HYSPLIT model. In ArcGIS clusters of trajectories were studied in connection with source maps by including the height above ground level and the speed of the air masses.    During the episode no evidence for a long distance transport from the continent of Alternaria spp. spores was detected. The overall direction of the air masses fell within the range from South-West to North. The back trajectories indicated that the most important sources of Alternaria spp. spores were located in the West Midlands of England.
Footprint Areas of Pollen From Alder (Alnus) and Birch (Betula) in the UK (Worcester) and Poland (Wrocław) During 2005–2014	In this study we analyzed daily pollen concentrations of Alnus spp. and Betula spp. from Worcester, UK and Wrocław,   Poland. We analyzed seasonality, annual pollen index and footprint areas for the observed pollen concentrations by using the trajectory model hybrid single particle Lagrangian integrated trajectory (HYSPLIT). We examined 10 years of data during the period 2005–2014 and found substantial differences in the seasonality, pollen indices and footprint areas. For both genera, concentrations in Wrocław are in general much higher, the seasons are shorter and therefore more intense than in Worcester. The reasons appear to be related to the differences in overall climate between the two sites and more abundant sources in Poland than in England. The footprint areas suggest that the source of the pollen grains are mainly local trees but appear to be augmented by remote sources, in particular for Betula spp. but only to a small degree for Alnus spp. For Betula spp., both sites appear to get contributions from areas in Germany, the Netherlands and Belgium, while known Betula   spp. rich regions in Russia, Belarus and Scandinavia had a very limited impact on the pollen concentrations in Worcester and Wrocław. Substantial and systematic variations in pollen indices are seen for Betula spp. in Wrocław with high values every second year while a similar pattern is not observed for Worcester. This pattern was not reproduced for Alnus spp.
An Assessment of the Potential for Co-exposure to Allergenic Pollen and Air Pollution in Copenhagen, Denmark	Co-exposure to air pollutants and pollen allergens can aggravate the allergic reaction and reduce the threshold at which susceptible individuals are affected. Here we assessed which air pollutants may be of particular relevance when investigating co-exposure with pollen. We examined the yearly variation and diurnal patterns of pollen and air pollution on days with peak pollen concentrations and non-peak days separately. The analysis was performed for measurements of grass and birch pollen, sulfur dioxide, ozone, nitrogen dioxide and particulate matter. Results indicated that high ozone concentrations coincide both seasonally and diurnally with high pollen concentrations, and that ozone concentrations were higher on peak pollen days, potentially leading to clinically relevant simultaneous co-exposure. For nitrogen dioxide and sulfur dioxide no periods with peaks simultaneously with peaks in pollen loads was identified, and concentrations were below potential thresholds for adjuvant effects to the allergic reaction. For particulate matter no simultaneous peaks in diurnal or seasonal concentrations were identified, however concentrations were higher on peak pollen days compared with non-peak days. When considering co-exposure effects from pollen and pollutants, ozone appears to be the most relevant pollutant to further examine for effects of simultaneous co-exposures.
Enabling Hospital Staff to Care for People with Dementia	This is the fourth and final article in a short series that presents case study examples of the positive work achieved by trusts who participated in the Royal College of Nursing’s development programme to improve dementia care in acute hospitals. Dementia training in hospitals is often inadequate  and staff do not always have sufficient knowledge of dementia to provide appropriate care. It can also be difficult for them to identify when patients with dementia are in pain, especially when their communication skills deteriorate. The case studies  presented illustrate how two NHS trusts have worked to ensure that their staff are fully equipped to care for people with dementia in hospital. Basildon and Thurrock University hospitals NHS Foundation Trust in Essex made dementia training  a priority by including dementia awareness in staff induction across a range of roles and providing additional training activities tailored to meet staff needs. Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust focused on pain assessment, aiming to standardise its approach for patients with dementia. The pain assessment in advanced dementia tool was chosen and piloted, and is being implemented across the trust after a positive response.
Reducing Social Isolation in a Rural Community Through Participation in Creative Arts Projects	This article reports the initial findings from the  evaluation of four creative arts projects involving  groups of older people living in a rural community.  The purpose of the projects was to reduce social  isolation among participants through providing direct  access to arts and social activities.  The view was that these activities would improve  life skills and independence, increase levels of activity  and improve the health, wellbeing and quality of life  of participants.  Evaluation of these projects demonstrated  increased levels of self-worth and self-esteem among  participants, and many of the older people involved  agreed that they had made new friends while having  the opportunity to try out a new activity.
How Mentors Can Influence Values, Behaviours and Attitudes of Nursing Staff Through Positive Professional Socialisation	This article explores the concept and processes involved in professional socialisation and how mentors and nurse managers can help to foster positive aspects of this in their practice. Positive professional socialisation needs champions to instil fundamental professional values and behaviours in nursing staff, and managers need to support mentors to influence and lead the way in promoting standards of excellence in the nursing profession to assure public trust and confidence, and ultimately patient safety. The time out activities will ask you to consider and develop possible strategies to help support mentors and staff, and aim to encourage you to explore the potential benefits of positive professional socialisation for your team in delivering high quality patient care.
A Systematic Review of the Effect of Cognitive Strategies on Strength Performance	Background  Researchers have tested the beliefs of sportspeople and sports medicine specialists that cognitive strategies influence strength performance. Few investigators have synthesised the literature.  Objectives  The specific objectives were to review evidence regarding (a) the cognitive strategy–strength performance relationship; (b) participant skill level as a moderator; and (c) cognitive, motivational, biomechanical/physiological, and emotional mediators.  Method  Studies were sourced via electronic databases, reference lists of retrieved articles, and manual searches of relevant journals. Studies had to be randomised or counterbalanced experiments with a control group or condition, repeated measures, and a quality control score above 0.5 (out of 1). Cognitive strategies included goal setting, imagery, self-talk, preparatory arousal, and free choice. Dependent variables included maximal strength, local muscular endurance, or muscular power.  Results  Globally, cognitive strategies were reliability associated with increased strength performance (results ranged from 61 to 65 %). Results were mixed when examining the effects of specific strategies on particular dependent variables, although no intervention had an overall negative influence. Indeterminate relationships emerged regarding hypothesised mediators (except cognitive variables) and participant skill level as a moderator.  Conclusions  Although cognitive strategies influence strength performance, there are knowledge gaps regarding specific types of strength, especially muscular power. Cognitive variables, such as concentration, show promise as possible mediators
Singing Better Songs? A Life History Study of Higher  Education Teacher Educators Working in the English Further  Education Sector	There has been a growth in the last 10 years of higher education provision in the English further  education sector. This article examines the thoughts and feelings of three higher-education-level  teachers working in the further education sector. Using Ivor Goodson’s life history approach,  it identifies a high degree of compliance with the system by the teachers. In order to justify the  conflict between organisational and teacher concerns, key strategies were formed. These included  celebrating further education as a place which gives people a second chance, a students-first focus  and the significance of the human connection made at work. There were also similarities between  the underlying motivations of teachers to teach at a higher level than many of their colleagues,  which included family, class, control and the significance of dominant others in their lives.
Admiral Nursing in Care Homes	Admiral Nurses provide much needed support in the community, but their growing role in care homes has had less attention. A new evaluation shows they are making a strong impact here too, report Isabelle Latham and colleagues.
Humour With a Purpose: Creativity With Language in Facebook  Status Updates	This paper examines everyday linguistic creativity and humour in Facebook status updates.  Analysis of the updates, collected in 2011 from 60 UK users, shows how people achieve particular  humorous tones through creative combinations of lexis and syntax, adding reinforcements  such as innovative punctuation to tighten the construction of the update. The linguistic  features they use are not in themselves novel, but the creativity lies in the individuals' effective  selection and use of them. The language is often playful, but the whole performance has a  serious purpose: people invite a sympathetic perspective on themselves. Humour, particularly  self-deprecation, is used to construct a personal narrative and thus perform their identity. In  short, the paper celebrates the capacity of ordinary people to seize opportunities for using  language skilfully and creatively to represent themselves and their lives.
Affective Temperaments and Concomitant Alcohol Use Disorders in Bipolar Disorder	BACKGROUND:  Alcohol misuse (AM) is more common in bipolar disorder (BD) than within the general population but the mechanisms of this association are unclear. We hypothesized that certain affective temperaments (including hyperthymic, cyclothymic, anxious, depressive and/or irritability) might represent 'fundamental states' contributing to risk of both AM and BD and we aimed to assess whether extremes of these five affective temperaments were associated with BD and concomitant AM status.  METHODS:  Our sample comprised 1420 individuals with BD who were recruited into a clinical-genetic study conducted by the Bipolar Disorder Research Network. Phenotypic assessments, including evaluation for AM and the 32-item TEMPS-A questionnaire, were conducted. Binary logistic regression was used to determine the effect of TEMPS-A scores on the likelihood of concomitant AM, with adjustment for confounders.  RESULTS:  Mean scores for four affective temperaments (hyperthymic, cyclothymic, depressive and irritable) were higher in cases (BD+AMs) than controls (BD only) (p<0.001). Hyperthymic and irritable temperaments in particular significantly increased the odds of concomitant AM within the BD sample after adjustment for potential confounders.  LIMITATIONS:  The definition of AM was not directly based on formal diagnostic classification systems. A retrospective, cross-sectional design was used. Our findings may not generalize to other countries and cultures.  CONCLUSIONS:  Higher scores on measures of hyperthymic and irritable temperament may contribute to the association between AM and BD. Assessing affective temperaments early in the course of BD may help to predict the development of an AM problem in vulnerable individuals.
Versatility in Phospho-dependent Molecular Recognition of the XRCC1 and XRCC4 DNA-damage Scaffolds by Aprataxin-family FHA Domains	Aprataxin, aprataxin and PNKP-like factor (APLF) and polynucleotide kinase phosphatase (PNKP) are key DNA-repair proteins with diverse functions but which all contain a homologous forkhead-associated (FHA) domain. Their primary binding targets are casein kinase 2-phosphorylated forms of the XRCC1 and XRCC4 scaffold molecules which respectively coordinate single-stranded and double-stranded DNA break repair pathways. Here, we present the high-resolution X-ray structure of a complex of phosphorylated XRCC4 with APLF, the most divergent of the three FHA domain family members. This, combined with NMR and biochemical analysis of aprataxin and APLF binding to singly and multiply-phosphorylated forms of XRCC1 and XRCC4, and comparison with PNKP reveals a pattern of distinct but overlapping binding specificities that are differentially modulated by multi-site phosphorylation. Together, our data illuminate important differences between activities of the three phospho-binding domains, in spite of a close evolutionary relationship between them.
New Zealand Blackcurrant Extract Improves Cycling Performance and Fat Oxidation in Cyclists	PURPOSE: Blackcurrant intake increases peripheral blood flow in humans, potentially by anthocyanin-induced vasodilation which may affect substrate delivery and exercise performance. We examined the effects of New Zealand blackcurrant (NZBC) extract on substrate oxidation, cycling time-trial performance and plasma lactate responses following the time-trial in trained cyclists. METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design, fourteen healthy men (age: 38 ± 13 years, height: 178 ± 4 cm, body mass: 77 ± 9 kg, V?O2max: 53 ± 6 ml·kg-1·min-1, mean ± SD) ingested NZBC extract (300 mg?day-1 CurraNZ™ containing 105 mg anthocyanin) or placebo (PL, 300 mg microcrystalline cellulose M102) for 7-days (washout 14-days). On day 7, participants performed 30 min of cycling (3x10 min at 45, 55 and 65% V?O2max), followed by a 16.1 km time-trial with lactate sampling during a 20-minute passive recovery. RESULTS: NZBC extract increased fat oxidation at 65% V?O2max by 27% (P < 0.05) and improved 16.1 km time-trial performance by 2.4% (NZBC: 1678 ± 108 s, PL: 1722 ± 131 s, P < 0.05). Plasma lactate was higher with NZBC extract immediately following the time-trial (NZBC: 7.06 ± 1.73 mmol?L-1, PL: 5.92 ± 1.58 mmol?L-1 P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Seven days intake of New Zealand blackcurrant extract improves 16.1 km cycling time-trial performance and increases fat oxidation during moderate intensity cycling.
Epilepsy and Bipolar Disorder	It is well recognized that mood disorders and epilepsy commonly co-occur. Despite this, our knowledge regarding the relationship between epilepsy and bipolar disorder is limited. Several shared features between the two disorders, such as their episodic nature and potential to run a chronic course, and the efficacy of some antiepileptic medications in the prophylaxis of both disorders, are often cited as evidence of possible shared underlying pathophysiology. The present paper aims to review the bidirectional associations between epilepsy and bipolar disorder, with a focus on epidemiological links, evidence for shared etiology, and the impact of these disorders on both the individual and wider society. Better recognition and understanding of these two complex disorders, along with an integrated clinical approach, are crucial for improved evaluation and management of comorbid epilepsy and mood disorders.
Cognitive Behaviour Therapy for Bulimia Nervosa and Eating Disorders Not Otherwise Specified: Translation from Randomized Controlled Trial to a Clinical Setting	BACKGROUND:  Enhanced Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT-E) (Fairburn, Cooper and Shafran, 2003) was developed as a treatment approach for eating disorders focusing on both core psychopathology and additional maintenance mechanisms.  AIMS:  To evaluate treatment outcomes associated with CBT-E in a NHS Eating Disorders Service for adults with bulimia and atypical eating disorders and to make comparisons with a previously published randomized controlled trial (Fairburn et al., 2009) and "real world" evaluation (Byrne, Fursland, Allen and Watson, 2011).  METHOD:  Participants were referred to the eating disorder service between 2002 and 2011. They were aged between 18-65 years, registered with a General Practitioner within the catchment area, and had experienced symptoms fulfilling criteria for BN or EDNOS for a minimum of 6 months.  RESULTS:  CBT-E was commenced by 272 patients, with 135 completing treatment. Overall, treatment was associated with significant improvements in eating disorder and associated psychopathology, for both treatment completers and the intention to treat sample.  CONCLUSIONS:  Findings support dissemination of CBT-E in this context, with significant improvements in eating disorder psychopathology. Improvements to global EDE-Q scores were higher for treatment completers and lower for the intention to treat sample, compared to previous studies (Fairburn et al., 2009; Byrne et al., 2011). Level of attrition was found at 40.8% and non-completion of treatment was associated with higher levels of anxiety. Potential explanations for these findings are discussed.
Student Perceptıons and Experıences of Problem-Based Learnıng in Fırst Year Undergraduate Sports Therapy	Problem-based learning (PBL) has long been used as a means to foster critical thinking and student autonomy. However, few studies have investigated the effectiveness of PBL in Sports Therapy. The aim of this study was to examine first year Sports Therapy students' perceptions of PBL. Results revealed that students perceived PBL as vocationally relevant, by enabling them to work in and across groups, whilst also engaging with a wider range and depth of information compared to more traditional methods of curriculum delivery. External observations of the lecturers input sessions were made by an impartial re- searcher. The implications of the study are that PBL appears to be a professionally suitable and appropriate learning modality for Sports Therapy students.
Strengthening the Links Between Research and Teaching: Cultivating Student Expectations of Research-informed Teaching Approaches	This article contributes to the pedagogical literature in drawing on findings from an institutional survey exploring perceptions of research-informed teaching, to examine how links between research and teaching can be suitably strengthened. Whilst the integration of research and teaching in higher education can provide valuable ways  of enhancing the student learning experience, establishing such integrative links can be complex and problematic given different practices and levels of understanding. Definitions of ‘research-informed’ teaching indicate variations with respect to the active involvement of students in research that can be compounded by  disciplinary traditions. The survey provided an indication of the extent to which research-informed teaching was practised at the University of Birmingham and thus an insight into understanding and practices. In particular, it offered insights into the ways in which research-informed  teaching relationships were interpreted and embedded within  disciplines, the barriers/difficulties to linking research and teaching and the perceived impact on the student learning experience. The findings suggest that understanding with respect to research-informed teaching  was variable, with a lack of understanding among students of precisely what it constitutes identified as being a key issue. In this paper we discuss the type of approaches that could support more active student engagement in the curriculum and call for the sharing of more curriculum examples from within the disciplines.
Reprint: Learning With a Strategic Management Simulation  Q2 Game: A Case Study	The use of simulation games as a pedagogic method is well established though its effective  use is context-driven. This study adds to the increasing growing body of empirical evidence  of the effectiveness of simulation games but more importantly emphasises why by  explaining the instructional design implemented reflecting best practices. This multimethod  study finds evidence that student learning was enhanced through the use of  simulation games, reflected in the two key themes; simulation games as a catalyst for  learning and simulation games as a vehicle for learning. In so doing the research provides  one of the few empirically based studies that support simulation games in enhancing  learning and, more importantly, contextualizes the enhancement in terms of the  instructional design of the curriculum. This research should prove valuable for those with  an academic interest in the use of simulation games and management educators who use,  or are considering its use. Further, the findings contribute to the academic debate concerning  the effective implementation of simulation game-based training in business and  management education.
The Relationship Between Connectedness to Nature, Environmental Values, and Pro-environmental Behaviours	The aims of this study were to investigate (a) the relationship between connectedness to nature and pro-environmental behaviours; (b) the relationship between environmental values and behaviours; and (c) whether or not there is a mediating effect of values in the relationship between connectedness and behaviour. Seventy-six undergraduate students completed an online survey that measured connectedness to nature, egoistic values, altruistic values, biospheric values, pro-environmental behaviours, and social desirability. The results showed that connectedness to nature, altruistic values and biospheric values were positively related to pro-environmental behaviours; and that environmental values partially mediated the relationship between connectedness to nature and pro-environmental behaviour. These results lend support to Wilson's (1984) biophilia hypothesis, which suggests that all humans are innately and emotionally connected to nature, and the value-belief-norm model of Stern, Dietz, Abel, Guagnano and Kalof (1999), which suggests that values activate cognitions that create a positive environmental personal norm to engage in pro-environmental behaviours.
Improving the Hospital Environment for People with Dementia	The hospital environment is often disorientating for people with dementia and can be particularly distressing when a patient is admitted in an emergency. Subsequent ward moves can also be disruptive and confusing, especially if they take place out of hours. Two NHS trusts aimed to improve the experience for patients with dementia by addressing the physical environment along with practical aspects of care provision at different stages in the hospital journey. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital King’s Lynn NHS Foundation Trust in Norfolk enhanced its emergency department environment by redesigning four bays and an observation area to be dementia-friendly. The hospital has supported these changes by providing dementia awareness training for all staff in these areas. Walsall Healthcare NHS Trust focused on minimising ward moves by implementing procedures to identify patients who should not be moved. Since introducing the new process, adherence has been good and there have been fewer ward moves.
Still Playing Together(?): A Recall to Physical Education and Sport History Intersections.	As academic disciplines, Physical Education and Sport History share interests in performance, participation, physique and the politics of corporeal praxis. Engendering unity between the two disciplines, however, has not been without concern. Scholars working within (and across) both fields have highlighted how the potential for shared knowledge production and meaning making has been, to a degree, stymied by epistemological and methodological criticism and trepidation. Issues over contextualization, rigour, narrative schemas, conceptualizations of the body, and notions of agency and power still, in particular, constrain our current educational and historical readings and renderings of physical culture(s). Scholarly schisms and methodological differences can be overcome, however, and need not prohibit disciplinary collaborations that might better address prevailing ethical questions and affect political cause; vis-à-vis the body, the physical and sport. This brief piece is, consequently, recourse to the scholarly symbiosis between Physical Education and Sport History and echoes the encouragement of our earlier colleagues to play, inquire, create and produce together.
Re-negotiating Ideologies of Bilingualism on the Margins of Education	This article reports on an ethnographic study carried out in three interrelated sites: two contrasting secondary schools and a Youth-Club (the principal focus of this article), in an area of southwest Wales. This article highlights the incongruence between the language at home and the language of the school and posits that the relationship between language use at school and in the wider community needs to be problematised and questioned far more than has been done thus far. This study questions whether school-based ideologies and school-based practices are re-negotiated or contested on the margins of education and whether this re-negotiation and contestation plays an important role in whether a young person chooses to use Welsh or English outside of school. It will be argued that recreational spaces, even though loosely connected to schools as institutions, function as more open spaces where institutional ideologies are actively reworked and renegotiated, either through choosing to use English or by mixing and blending different aspects of linguistic resources, or by re-negotiating and questioning which version of Welshness is more valuable, ‘the removed and authentic’ (as seen at the Welsh school) or the ‘new and hybrid’ as seen at the Youth-Club.
The Effects of French Organisational Relationships on Telework Job Roles: an Exploratory Role Set Analysis	Telework refers to work carried out using some form of information technology away from the tradition workplace.  This paper explores using role set analysis and analyses a pilot scheme of a French public sector organisation.  The investigation focuses on the effects of the interplay between teleworkers with the office based colleagues and line managers, viewed through their relationship interaction and experiences.  Some findings from this study agree with arguments from the literature. Others bring new insight.  Despite benefits for teleworkers, telework can generate burdens for their colleagues and alter work organisation for managers.  Findings also reveal that changes in job roles can have deeper effects on cultural and organisational norms because they challenge assumptions of the traditional workplace.
A Follow-up Study Examining Airborne Ambrosia Pollen  in the Milan Area in 2014 in Relation to the Accidental  Introduction of the Ragweed Leaf Beetle Ophraella Communa	The North American invasive alien Ambrosia artemisiifolia L. (common or short ragweed) is considered to be an important weed in agriculture and source of highly allergenic pollen (Smith et al. 2013; Essl et al. 2015 references therein) in many parts of the world, including Europe. The oligophagous leaf beetle Ophraella communa LeSage 1986 (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) preferably feeds from A. artemisiifolia, and is successfully used as a biological agent to control this weed in China (Zhou et al. 2014). It can prevent plants from producing seeds and pollen when it kills them before flowering. In 2013, this  beetle was found to have accidentally established in  Southern Switzerland and Northern Italy, with high  incidence and densities in the Milan area Muller Scharer  et al. 2014). The map showing the presence of the beetle has now been updated for 2014 (Fig. 1). We have previously shown, using linear regression models,  that the exceptionally low amounts of airborne  Ambrosia pollen observed in the Milan area in 2013  could not be explained by meteorology in that year.  We therefore suggested that the decrease might be  related to the presence of large numbers of O.  communa (Bonini et al. 2015)
Validation Française de l’Échelle de la Personnalité Temporelle (French Validation of the Time Personality Indicator)	RÉSUMÉ  Certains auteurs ont développé un intérêt pour la compréhension des aptitudes associées à la gestion du temps. Ainsi, plusieurs définitions théoriques ont été proposées afin de mieux cerner ce concept et une  multitude de questionnaires a été développée afin de le mesurer. La présente étude visait à valider la traduction française d’un de ces outils, soit le Time  Personality Indicator (TPI). Des analyses exploratoires et confirmatoires ont été effectuées sur l’ensemble des données recueillies auprès de 1 267 étudiants et employés de l’Université Laval ayant complété la version française du TPI ainsi que d’autres mesures de la personnalité. Les résultats ont révélé qu’une solution à huit facteurs permet de mieux décrire les données de l’échantillon. La discussion présente les raisons pour lesquelles la version française du TPI est valide, identifie certaines limites de la présente étude et souligne l’utilité de cet outil pour la recherche sur la gestion du temps.    (ABSTRACT: Numerous authors have developed an interest towards the understanding of the abilities  related to time management. As a consequence, multiple theoretical definitions have  been proposed to explain time management. Likewise, several questionnaires have been  developed in order to measure this concept. The aim of this study was to validate a French version of one of these tools, namely the Time Personality Indicator (TPI). The French  version of the TPI and other personality questionnaires were completed by 1267 students  and employees of Université Laval. The statistical approach used included exploratory  and confirmatory analyses. Results revealed that an eight factor model provided a better  adjustment to the data. The discussion provides arguments supporting the validity of the  French version of the TPI and underlines the importance of such a tool for the research on  time management)
Just How Wide Should 'Wide Reading' Be?	Educationalists introduce students to literature search strategies that,with rare exceptions, focus chiefly on the location of primary research reports and systematic reviews of those reports. These sources are, however, unlikely to adequately address the normative and/or metaphysical  questions that nurses frequently and legitimately interest themselves in. To meet these interests, non-research texts exploring normative and/or metaphysical topics might and perhaps should, in some situations, be deemed suitable search targets. This seems plausible and, moreover, students are encouraged to ‘read widely’. Yet accepting this proposition creates significant difficulties. Specifically, if non-research scholarly sources and artistic or literary (humanities) products dealing with  normative/metaphysical issues were included in what are, at present, scientifically orientated searches, it is difficult to draw boundaries around what – if anything – is to be excluded. Engaging with this issue highlights problems with qualitative scholarship’s designation as ‘evidence’. Thus, absurdly, if qualitative scholarship’s findings are labelled evidence because they generate practice-relevant understanding/insight, then any literary or artistic artefact (e.g. a throwaway lifestyle magazine) that generates kindred understandings/insights is presumably also evidence? This conclusion is rejected and it is instead proposed that while artistic, literary, and qualitative inquiries can provide practitioners with powerful and stimulating non-evidential understanding, these sources are not evidence as commonly conceived.
The Immunosuppressive Ligands PD-L1 and CD200 are Linked in AML T-cell Immunosuppression: Identification of a New Immunotherapeutic Synapse	Long-term remission in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is generally not durable only being achieved in <50% of patients. Consequently there is a need to establish new treatments to prevent relapse. A promising approach is to augment the anti-tumor immune response in these patients; however, it is well established that overexpression of immunosuppressive molecules such as CD200 on the surface of AML cells directly suppresses the antitumor response. Nevertheless, blocking CD200:CD200R, only partially restores T-cell activity, suggesting that alternative immunosuppressive mechanisms need to be explored if the antitumor response in AML is to be optimally exploited.
Improving Activity and Engagement for Patients with Dementia	This is the second in a short series that presents case study examples of the positive work achieved by trusts that participated in the Royal College of Nursing’s development programme to improve dementia care in acute hospitals. Staff often think that there is insufficient time to get to know patients and carers, especially with large and challenging workloads.  Combined with a lack of activities and stimulation for patients with dementia in hospital, this can result in poor engagement and a disconnect between staff and patients. To improve these relationships and give staff more time with patients, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust has introduced bay nursing for patients with dementia, where one nurse is responsible for monitoring a bay alongside a healthcare assistant for an entire shift. Part of Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, Glan Clwyd Hospital in North Wales has focused on improving stimulation by creating an activity room with a specially trained activity worker, providing a relaxed and friendly setting where patients with dementia can take part in a range of activities and have lunch together.
Relationships Among Muscle Dysmorphia Characteristics, Body Image Quality of Life, and Coping in Males	Abstract  Objectives  The purpose of this study was to examine relationships among bodybuilding dependence, muscle satisfaction, body image-related quality of life and body image-related coping strategies, and test the hypothesis that muscle dysmorphia characteristics may predict quality of life via coping strategies.    Design  Participants (294 males, Mage = 20.5 years, SD = 3.1) participated in a cross-sectional survey.    Methods  Participants completed questionnaires assessing muscle satisfaction, bodybuilding dependence, body image-related quality of life and body image-related coping.    Results  Quality of life was correlated positively with muscle satisfaction and bodybuilding dependence but negatively with body image coping (P < 0.05). Body image coping was correlated positively with bodybuilding dependence and negatively with muscle satisfaction (P < 0.05). Mediation analysis found that bodybuilding dependence and muscle satisfaction predicted quality of life both directly and indirectly via body image coping strategies (as evidenced by the bias corrected and accelerated bootstrapped confidence intervals).    Conclusions  These results provide preliminary evidence regarding the ways that muscularity concerns might influence body image-related quality of life.
Using DNA Metabarcoding to Identify the Floral Composition of Honey: a New Tool for Investigating Honey Bee Foraging  Preferences	Identifying the floral composition of honey provides a method for investigating the plants that honey bees visit. We compared melissopalynology, where pollen grains retrieved from honey are identified morphologically, with a DNA metabarcoding approach using the rbcL DNA barcode marker and 454-pyrosequencing. We compared nine honeys supplied by beekeepers in the UK. DNA metabarcoding and melissopalynology were able to detect the most abundant floral components of honey. There was 92% correspondence for the plant taxa that had an abundance of over 20%. However, the level of similarity when all taxa were  compared was lower, ranging from 22–45%, and there was little correspondence between the relative abundance of taxa found using the two techniques. DNA metabarcoding provided much greater repeatability, with a 64% taxa match compared to 28% with melissopalynology. DNA metabarcoding has the advantage over melissopalynology in that it does not require a high level of taxonomic expertise, a greater sample size can be screened and it provides greater resolution for some plant families. However, it does not provide a quantitative approach and pollen present in low levels are less likely to be detected. We investigated  the plants that were frequently used by honey bees by examining the results obtained from both techniques. Plants with a broad taxonomic range were detected, covering 46 families and 25 orders, but a relatively small number of plants were consistently seen across multiple honey samples. Frequently found herbaceous species were Rubus fruticosus, Filipendula ulmaria, Taraxacum officinale, Trifolium spp., Brassica spp. and the non-native, invasive, Impatiens glandulifera. Tree pollen was frequently seen belonging to Castanea sativa, Crataegus monogyna and species of Malus, Salix and Quercus.We conclude that  although honey bees are considered to be supergeneralists in their foraging choices, there are certain key species or plant groups that are particularly important in the honey bees environment. The reasons for this require further investigation in order to better understand honey bee nutritional requirements. DNA metabarcoding can be easily and widely used to investigate floral visitation in honey bees and can be adapted for use with other insects. It  provides a starting point for investigating how we can better provide for the insects that we rely upon for pollination.
Spatial, Temporal and Vertical Distribution of Ammonia Concentrations Over Europe – Comparing a Static and Dynamic Approach With WRF-Chem	The study focuses on the application of a dynamic ammonia emission into the Weather Research and Forecasting Chemistry model (WRF-Chem) and the influence on the simulated ammonia concentrations and the overall model performance. We have focused on agricultural ammonia sources and have analysed both hourly and daily patterns of ammonia emissions and concentrations at measurement sites located in agricultural areas or influenced by this activity. For selected episodes, we have also investigated the 3-D patterns of the ammonia concentrations in the atmosphere. The application of the dynamic ammonia emission into the WRF-Chem model (the “DYNAMIC” simulation) results in an improvement of the modelled daily ammonia concentrations in comparison to a static approach (the “BASE” simulation), which is currently widely used in chemical transport models. In the case of hourly resolution, we have observed an improvement for the DYNAMIC approach for the winter and autumn seasons, but for  the entire year the modelled hourly ammonia peaks are shifted toward the afternoon hours if compared with measurements. This study indicates that the current description of the diurnal cycle of the ammonia concentration from fields is not accurate and more research is needed in order to improve the processes that describe the emission from fertilised fields. The results suggest that the governing processes in relation to the diurnal cycle are the atmospheric mixing and the emission strength. Therefore,an improved description of the diurnal profile of ammonia concentrations within atmospheric models requires a better description of the planetary boundary layer height and a stronger daily pattern of ammonia emission, e.g. through increased evaporation or increased fluxes from the surface.
Exploring Emerging Occupational Therapy Identity and the Development of Graduate Attributes Among Occupational Therapy Students	Introduction: Strong professional identity allows for appropriate representation and promotion of occupational therapy. Academic education assists in the development of occupational therapy identity. This study aims to explore the development of occupational therapy identity and graduate attributes in occupational therapy students after the first year of a revised curriculum.  Method: Occupational therapy students (n¼58) were surveyed at the commencement of the second year. Data analysis used  descriptive statistics and inferential statistics (v2 for trend).  Results: A total of 54 students (93.1%) completed the survey. Students progressively developed occupational therapy identity over time. There were no significant associations between main factors influencing the original decision to study occupational therapy and when occupational therapy identity developed. However, there were significant associations between main factors influencing students’ decision to continue studying and when identity developed. Most students agreed the curriculum equipped them to develop graduate attributes, although this was not significantly associated with factors that either influenced students to study, or continue studying, occupational therapy. There was significant association between development of graduate attributes and  occupational therapy identity over time.  Conclusion: This study showed an emergence of occupational therapy identity and graduate attributes in students, demonstrating the importance of first year curriculum in the development of these factors.
Targeting the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null Phenotype in Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia with Pro-oxidants	Inactivation of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated gene in chronic lymphocytic leukemia results in resistance to p53-dependent apoptosis and inferior responses to treatment with DNA damaging agents. Hence, p53-independent strategies are required to target Ataxia  Telangiectasia Mutated-deficient chronic lymphocytic leukemia. As Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated has been implicated in redox homeostasis, we investigated the effect of the Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null chronic lymphocytic leukemia genotype on cellular responses to  oxidative stress with a view to therapeutic targeting. We found that in comparison to Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-wild type chronic lymphocytic leukemia, pro-oxidant treatment of Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null cells led to reduced binding of NF-E2 p45-related factor-2 to antioxidant response elements and thus decreased expression of target genes. Furthermore, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells contained lower levels of antioxidants and elevated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species. Consequently, Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null chronic lymphocytic leukemia, but not tumours with 11q deletion or TP53 mutations, exhibited differentially increased sensitivity to pro-oxidants both in vitro and in vivo. We found that cell death was mediated by a p53- and caspase-independent mechanism associated with apoptosis inducing factor activity. Together, these data suggest that defective redox-homeostasis represents an attractive therapeutic target for Ataxia Telangiectasia Mutated-null chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
Layers of Listening: Qualitative Analysis of the Impact of Early Intervention Services for First-episode Psychosis on Carers' Experiences	Background    Early intervention services (EIS) comprise low-stigma, youth-friendly mental health teams for young people undergoing first-episode psychosis (FEP). Engaging with the family of the young person is central to EIS policy and practice.    Aims    By analysing carers' accounts of their daily lives and affective challenges during a relative's FEP against the background of wider research into EIS, this paper explores relationships between carers' experiences and EIS.    Method    Semi-structured longitudinal interviews with 80 carers of young people with FEP treated through English EIS.    Results    Our data suggest that EIS successfully aid carers to support their relatives, particularly through the provision of knowledge about psychosis and medications. However, paradoxical ramifications of these user-focused engagements also emerge; they risk leaving carers' emotions unacknowledged and compounding an existing lack of help-seeking.    Conclusions    By focusing on EIS's engagements with carers, this paper draws attention to an urgent broader question: as a continuing emphasis on care outside the clinic space places family members at the heart of the care of those with severe mental illness, we ask: who can, and should, support carers, and in what ways?
Understanding the Needs of People with Dementia and Family Carers	This is the first in a short series that presents case study examples of the positive work achieved by trusts who participated in the Royal College of Nursing's development programme to improve dementia care in acute hospitals.  When a person with dementia is in hospital, poor understanding of individual needs and preferences can contribute to a lack of person-centred care. Similarly, the needs of family carers can often be overlooked and staff do not always appreciate these needs at such a stressful time. This article illustrates how three NHS trusts have addressed these issues. To help staff get to know patients with dementia, Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust has implemented a patient passport. Similarly, The Shrewsbury and Telford Hospital NHS Trust has implemented a carer passport that overcomes the restrictions imposed by hospital visiting hours. Royal Devon and Exeter NHS Foundation Trust also focused on carers, holding a workshop to elicit feedback on what was important to them. This was a useful means of engaging with carers and helped staff to realise that even simple changes can have a significant effect.
Establishing a Community of Practice for Occupational  Therapy Curriculum Development: The value of a Two-way  Process	Introduction: A novel application of the concept of a  community of practice was adopted in the development of  a revised curriculum for undergraduate occupational therapy  education in July 2012. University Academic staff and invited practice scholars met together, half yearly for day long meetings to develop and review a new curriculum.  The formation of this community of practice allowedfor open discourse and feedback to integrate theory and practice.  Method: A qualitative study utilised two focus groups,  one for academic staff and one for practice scholars, at the  end of the third meeting. The focus groups were facilitated  by an external researcher, recorded and transcribed verbatim.Thematic analysis elicited five major themes.  Findings: Participants reported a sense of community and  commitment to the curriculum process. Five themes emerged from the focus groups: (i) a sense of community; (ii) a two-way process with mutual benefits; (iii) benefits to the curriculum and to student learning; (iv) future opportunities including resilience of graduates, and potential research collaborations; and (v) the structure and process of engaging in the community of practice.  Conclusion: The commitment of time, planning and resources required to establish and participate in collaborative  curriculum development with practice scholars is shown to be a valuable investment for occupational therapy academics, expert practice scholars and ultimately for student learning. Further studies of student and graduate  outcomes from the curriculum are warranted. Potential future outcomes of this process include resilience in graduates and collaborative research with practice scholars.
Beneficial Physiological Effects with Blackcurrant Intake in Endurance Athletes	Blackcurrant contains anthocyanins, known to influence vasorelaxation and peripheral blood flow. We examined the effects of 7 days intake of Sujon New Zealand blackcurrant powder (6g/day) on the lactate curve, maximum oxygen uptake, and cardiovascular responses at rest and during cycling. Thirteen trained triathletes with >3 yrs experience (8 men, age: 38±8 yrs, body mass: 71±9 kg, BF%: 19±5%, mean±SD) performed two incremental cycling protocols with recording of physiological and cardiovascular responses (Portapres® Model 2). Cardiovascular function was also measured in rest. Experimental design was double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized and cross-over (wash-out 4 wks). Data was analysed with two-tailed t-tests and 2-way ANOVA and significance accepted at p<0.05. Plasma lactate was lower at 40%, 50%, 60% and 70% of maximum power by 27%, 22%, 17% and 13%. Intensity at 4 mmol?L-1 OBLA was 6% higher with blackcurrant without effect on heart rate and oxygen uptake. Maximum values of oxygen uptake, heart rate and power were not affected by blackcurrant, but obtained with 14% lower lactate. In rest, blackcurrant increased stroke volume and cardiac output by 25% and 26%, and decreased total peripheral resistance by 16%, with no changes in blood pressure and heart rate. Cardiovascular responses during exercise at 40%, 50%, 60%, 70% and 80% intensity were not affected. Sujon New Zealand blackcurrant powder affects lactate production and/or clearance during exercise. Sujon New Zealand blackcurrant powder affects physiological and cardiovascular responses in rest and during exercise that may have implications for exercise performance.
Readjusting our Sporting Sites/Sight: Sportification and the Theatricality of Social Life	This paper points out the potential of using sport for the analysis of society. Cultivated human movement is a specific social and cultural subsystem (involving sport, movement culture and physical culture), yet it becomes a part of wider social discourses by extending some of its characteristics into various other spheres. This process, theorised as sportification, provides as useful concept to examine the permeation of certain phenomena from the area of sport into the social reality outside of sport. In this paper, we investigate the phenomena of sportification which we parallel with visual culture and spectatorship practices in the Renaissance era. The emphasis in our investigation is on theatricality and performativity; particularly, the superficial spectator engagement with modern sport and sporting spectacles. Unlike the significance afforded to visualisation and deeper symbolic interpretation in Renaissance art, contemporary cultural shifts have changed and challenged the ways in which the active and interacting body is positioned, politicised, symbolised and ultimately understood. We suggest here that the ways in which we view sport and sporting bodies within a (post)modern context (particularly with the confounding amalgamations of signs and symbols and emphasis on hyper-realities) has invariably become detached from sports’ profound metaphysical meanings and resonance. Subsequently, by emphasising the associations between social theatrics and the sporting complex, this paper aims to remind readers of ways that sport—as a nuanced phenomenon—can be operationalised to help us to contemplate questions about nature, society, ourselves and the complex worlds in which we live.
Variation of the Group 5 Grass Pollen Allergen Content of Airborne Pollen in Relation to Geographical Location and Time in Season	Allergies to grass pollen are the number one cause of outdoor hay fever. The human immune system reacts with symptoms to allergens from pollen.  Objective: We investigated the natural variability in release of the major group 5 allergen from grass  pollen across Europe.  Methods: Airborne pollen and allergens were simultaneously collected daily with a volumetric spore  trap and a high-volume cascade impactor at 10 sites across Europe for 3 consecutive years. Group 5 allergen was determined with a Phl p 5 specific ELISA in two fractions of ambient air:  Particulate Matter  (PM)  >10μm  and  10μm>PM>2.5μm.  Mediator  release  by  ambient  air  was  determined  in  FcεR1-humanized basophils. Origin of pollen was modeled and condensed to pollen potency maps.  Results: On average grass pollen released 2.3 pg Phl p 5/pollen. Allergen release per pollen (potency) varied substantially, ranging from 0 to 9 pg Phl p 5/pollen (5 to 95% percentile). The main variation was locally day-to-day. Average potency maps across Europe varied between years. Mediator release from basophilic granulocytes correlated better with allergen/m3 (r2=0.80, p<0.001) than with  pollen/m3 (r2=0.61, p<0.001). In addition, pollen released different amounts of allergen in the nonpollen  bearing fraction of ambient air depending on humidity.  Conclusion: Across Europe, the same amount of pollen released substantially different amounts of group 5 grass pollen allergen. This variation in allergen release is on top of variations in pollen counts. Molecular aerobiology, i.e. determining allergen in ambient air, may be a valuable addition to pollen counting.
Uplink Spectral Efficiency Analysis of In-Building Distributed Antenna Systems	Providing high data rate wireless transmissions has  been difficult in indoor environments, particularly in multi-floor buildings. One way to achieve high data rate wireless transmissions is to reduce the radio transmission distance between the transmitter and the receiver by using distributed antenna systems (DASs) and employing frequency reuse. However, due to the reuse of the limited available spectrum, co-channel interference  can severely degrade system capacity. In this paper, the uplink spectral efficiency of an in-building DAS with frequency reuse is studied, where remote antenna units (RAUs) deployed on each floor throughout the building are connected to a central unit (CU) where received signals are processed. The impact of cochannel interference on system performance is investigated by using a propagation channel model derived from multi-floor, in-building measurement results. The proposed scheme exploits the penetration loss of the signal through the floors, resulting in frequency reuse in spatially separated floors, which increases system spectral efficiency and also reduces co-channel interference. A comparative analysis with conventional co-located antenna deployment at the floor center is provided. Location based RAU selection and deployment options are investigated. System  performance is evaluated in terms of location-specific spectral efficiency for a range of potential mobile terminal (MT) locations and various in-building propagation characteristics.
HND Degree 'Top-up' Students' Perceptions of Their Experience at the University of Worcester: How Can Future Students' Experiences Be Improved?	This study investigated the experiences of students on a   top-up degree course in the Institute of Sport and Exercise Science. Two students on the current ‘top-up’ were interviewed after having completed a HND at a partner college which revealed some useful insights in relation to their experiences on the degree course.For example, these students noted that as well as greater demands being placed on them at University compared with College, feedback was more relaxed on the HND. The students proposed the notion of a 'move-up' day prior to studying the degree top-up in order to settle students quickly onto their degree course and to smooth a successful transition onto the top-  up course.
'Usemyability’ (UMA). An Investigation Into Whether   an Online Employability Skills Audit Can Enhance Students Understanding of the Term Employability	This project was completed as part of the students as   academic partners (SAPs) initiative. The project aimed to   ascertain the current level of understanding surrounding   students’ employability skills and how they may be improved. It was expected that through the use of an   online self-audit tool ‘usemyability’ (UMA 1) students   would be able to establish a benchmark from which to   track their development across a range of 16 benchmarked employability skills. A baseline questionnaire was completed by 31 University of Worcester (UW) students to investigate their existing knowledge surrounding the concept of employability.   Results suggested that students had a limited understanding of the term employability. Notably, students regarded employability as simply ‘getting a job’ (9 students suggested this) or ‘having skills’ (12 students noted this). Skills listed focussed around personal attributes (including reliability and confidence) illustrating discrepancies in what students think employers look for (attributes) and what employers actually look for (skills, literacy, being ICT efficient for example) (Archer & Davison, 2008). The UMA audit allowed students to document their skills and work experiences to date, as well as further educate students on employability skills. Students stated benefits associated with completing the UMA audit and provided relevant examples in support of this. A number of limitations to the project, including timing and length of the audit were identified by students. Further limitations identified by the researchers included the timing of the study within the academic year, low participation rates and attendance of participants on the day of the presentation of employability skills. A greater response sample is required to generalise the impact of the UMA audit on a wider scale.
The Impact of Critical Thinking Disposition on Learning Using Business Simulations	This research seeks to determine the relationship between students’ critical thinking disposition and their learning while engaging in a business simulation at a UK higher education institution (HEI). The research informs educators making decisions about the use of simulations as to the value of considering critical thinking dispositions. Previous research has found that simulations are an effective way for students to engage actively in learning, bridging the gap between theory and practice. It has also been found that such simulations can develop students’ critical thinking skills. However, hitherto no research has been undertaken into the role that existing critical thinking disposition has on the learning of students, as measured by the degree to which students perceived that they met the module’s intended learning outcomes. This research offers insights into the role and importance of critical thinking disposition and its component dimensions and how this impacts student learning. The results indicate that the level of critical thinking disposition is positively related to the students’ learning. The implications of the research suggest educators should target business simulations at specific cohorts of students.  The relative importance of the critical thinking disposition constructs and the practical educational implications of these findings are discussed.
Postgraduate Perspectives on E-feedback	This research project examined the assessment feedback method used for summative coursework on a postgraduate, blended learning programme within the Institute of Health and Society. The aim was to determine if and how the introduction of electronic feedback changes the way students interact and learn from feedback. This study was undertaken with the participants from four student c  ohorts from the same Master’s degree programme. An electronic survey questionnaire with primarily open  -ended questions was utilised to collect qualitative data about their learning exper ience and the proposed changes.   Data was analysed for thematic content using the principles of grounded theory. Responses were analysed manually for key words or sentences, phrases and themes. Codes were applied and then sorted into category schemes. Responses were received from 28 students. Data analysis of the questionnaire responses identified 22 codes. The codes were further analysed to identify simple category schemes, these were identified as relating to convenience, timing, the student’s processing of feedback, contact with the tutor or about the actual comments given in the feedback. 10 of the responders had received electronic feedback via the student online learning environment (SOLE) system via one of the trial modules. 17 responders had not received electronic feedback via the SOLE system. Results highlight the importance of timely feedback within modular postgraduate study and the importance of regular access to face-to-face tutorial contact with academic staff.   Electronic feedback has the potential to allow students   more time to review and engage with feedback and to   deliver many benefits that are perceived as convenient   and timely, however it is still perceived by some as   impersonal and offering no added benefits when compared to handwritten feedback. The main recommendations are to use e  -feedback on all modules within the postgraduate programme whilst formalising the offer of face to face or telephone feedback tutorials to maintain personal contact. Formative feedback sessions within modules should continue to be developed, building reflective skills of learners en  couraging both self and peer assessment.
The Effectiveness of Online Instructional Videos in the Acquisition and Demonstration of Cognitive, Affective and Psychomotor Rehabilitation Skills.	The use of instructional videos to teach clinical skills is an ever growing area of e-learning based upon observational learning which is cited as one of the most basic yet powerful learning strategies. The aim of the current study is to evaluate the effectiveness of online instructional videos for the acquisition and demonstration of cognitive, affective and psychomotor skills amongst Undergraduate students, throughout formative assessments with two different durations of instructional videos. The research suggests that the use of videos to support traditional learning should be encouraged, whilst a conclusive evidence - base for their usage has not yet been established they are a medium which is likely to benefit a proportion of a cohort, and it is very unlikely that they will be harmful to students' learning.
Familiality and SNP Heritability of Age at Onset and Episodicity in Major Depressive Disorder	BACKGROUND:  Strategies to dissect phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of major depressive disorder (MDD) have mainly relied on subphenotypes, such as age at onset (AAO) and recurrence/episodicity. Yet, evidence on whether these subphenotypes are familial or heritable is scarce. The aims of this study are to investigate the familiality of AAO and episode frequency in MDD and to assess the proportion of their variance explained by common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP heritability).  METHOD:  For investigating familiality, we used 691 families with 2-5 full siblings with recurrent MDD from the DeNt study. We fitted (square root) AAO and episode count in a linear and a negative binomial mixed model, respectively, with family as random effect and adjusting for sex, age and center. The strength of familiality was assessed with intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). For estimating SNP heritabilities, we used 3468 unrelated MDD cases from the RADIANT and GSK Munich studies. After similarly adjusting for covariates, derived residuals were used with the GREML method in GCTA (genome-wide complex trait analysis) software.  RESULTS:  Significant familial clustering was found for both AAO (ICC = 0.28) and episodicity (ICC = 0.07). We calculated from respective ICC estimates the maximal additive heritability of AAO (0.56) and episodicity (0.15). SNP heritability of AAO was 0.17 (p = 0.04); analysis was underpowered for calculating SNP heritability of episodicity.  CONCLUSIONS:  AAO and episodicity aggregate in families to a moderate and small degree, respectively. AAO is under stronger additive genetic control than episodicity. Larger samples are needed to calculate the SNP heritability of episodicity. The described statistical framework could be useful in future analyses.
Inertia, Friendships or Effective Relationship Marketing? Remaining at the Same University for a Taught Master’s Degree	This paper focuses on the influencing factors of individual students who remain at the same University for their postgraduate study. By interviewing students on an MSc Management course, we found some interesting motivations about where to continue studying a taught postgraduate course. These factors included such issues as the importance of developing and maintaining personal effective relationships, peer group influence and a sense of belonging.
[arra]stre - a Data-driven Ballet	[arra]stre is a data-driven ballet performance that makes extensive use of visualisation with data generated from the choreography and dancers. Whilst visualisations of this kind are not uncommon in performance dance, what marks this work out is that the visualisation and choreography were treated as equal actors in the exploration of the theme rather than the visualisation either becoming the dominant character in the performance (with the dancers simply providing a trigger) or being completely passive - an echo of the movement.
Does This Lecture Come with a Trigger Warning? The Challenge of Teaching Sensitive Topics	The hectic nature of modern life requires each of us to   find our own way to relax and put the challenges of work   to one side. My distraction of choice is a popular internet   discussion forum where readers can post on an array of   topics, from the best way to paint old furniture to   addressing the challenge of how to get children to eat   more vegetables (for the record, I still have no answer to   this). For as long as I can remember, it has been the case   that you read the brief, and the rather general title of a   thread and make a snap decision about whether to click   into it, taking your chances that it is going to be   something that is of interest to you. Recently though,   there seems to be an interesting new trend in thread titles. Many now contain the phrases ‘warning’, ‘possible   trigger’ or ‘sensitive’. Apparently, this is to warn forum   users that the thread contains some information that some   users may find upsetting, so they can make an informed   choice about whether to avoid the thread in question.   Issues such as child abuse, pregnancy loss and mental   illness have all been subject to this signposting within the thread title. This appears to be a very po  sitive step forward in terms of informing the reader and allowing them to make considered choices about what they expose themselves to. This increased emphasis on signposting resonates strongly with me as a lecturer in forensic psychology, where there is often a requirement to present extremely sensitive topics to students, and I wonder whether some of the signposting techniques used on the discussion board could inform the way that we address   this issue.
The Role of Posters as a Means of Summative Assessment.	This research centres on whether the use of posters as a means of summative assessment can help promote students’ learning within an undergraduate research module, compared to that of the more traditionally based written assignment.  This interpretative research study used a mixed methods approach for gathering data. This included the use of quantitative module results as well as qualitative data derived from semi-structured interviews and questionnaires.  The findings from this study supports the notion that poster do in fact promote student learning and enjoyment when studying the identified research methods undergraduate module.  Posters were seen to promote enjoyment when undertaking the summative assessment as well as providing opportunities for promoting deep learning.  Further to this posters can have the ability to promote higher order thinking skills as well as facilitating and informing future learning.
Enhancing Student Learning Experiences in Sport Psychology Modules Using Practical Activities	The University of Worcester states in its most recent strategic plan (2013 – 2018) a set of enduring values that guide and direct the activities of the institution.  The first listed, and perhaps the most important value is the striving to be “an outstanding university at which to be a student”. This is further supplemented by values such as “to inspire our students to reach their full potential through excellent, innovative teaching, scholarship and research” (University of Worcester 2013: p.4). One of the many ways in which the institution strives to provide this outstanding educational experience is through regular engagement, both formal and informal, with students at a number of points in each semester. Regular experiences of collating formal and informal feedback has led to the identification of a common theme amongst Higher National Diploma (HND) students in the Institute of Sport and Exercise Sciences (ISES), where they consistently request ‘more practicals’. The ISES modules however are designed to incorporate a high degree of interaction, practical activities and tasks. This is especially important for those studying at HND level as research suggests differences in learning preferences exist when compared to undergraduate students, the former preferring a more tactile style of learning (Peters et al. 2008). Using an introductory Sport Psychology HND module as an example, practical activities and tasks are fully embedded in the taught sessions to enable contextual links to be made between the learning outcomes and their subsequent use. Examples of these include:   a. interviewing athletes to produce a performance profile (Butler & Hardy 1992);   b. completing psychometric instruments such as the Competitive State Anxiety Inventory-2 (CSAI-2) to measure competitive anxiety in sport (Martens et al. 1990) and demonstrate data collection and construct measurement;   c. performing relaxation interventions on the students to demonstrate how specific techniques (in this instance, decreasing somatic anxiety) might work in practice;   d. demonstrating how observational learning facilitates skill acquisition by creating experimental  conditions that the students participate in, in teaching a new skill.   Nevertheless owing to the students' previously stated on-going requests for more practical activities, it became evident that assumptions about what students consider an effective means of experiential or active learning in the context of sport-related disciplines of study needed to be investigated. This is where the opportunity to undertake an action research project arose, this being a practical method commonly employed in pedagogical enquiry to aid reflection on teaching and assessment practice for the purposes of working towards continuous improvement.
Proper Placements	How useful are student practitioners for managers?  What advice would they give to early years students on placement?
Fandom in the Workplace: Multi-target Identification in Professional Team Sports.	Team identification has been researched extensively from the perspective of the consumer. The current study proposes that employees working in professional sport may also be fans of their respective teams, and provides insight on the role of team identification in the workplace environment. Over 1100 business operations employees from the top profession sports leagues in North America participated, and results indicate that dual targets of identification exist simultaneously in this setting. Strong support is provided for the discriminant validity between organizational and team identification. Beyond the more established effects of organizational identification, the results provide evidence that team identification independently predicts key outcomes such as commitment, satisfaction, and motivation. The results add to the literature by introducing the concept of a sports team as an additional target of identification in the organizational context.
Teaching Children’s Literature: An Overview	This article is an overview of the study of children’s literature from an international perspective. The study of writing for children can reveal much about a culture since the constructs of culture, national identity and values are embedded in writing for children, no matter where it originates. The stories we tell and how they are told formulate and shape the reader whether the authorial intention is to imbibe or critique a particular perspective. The study of children’s literature deconstructs the text and reconstructs an argument bringing a deeper understanding of cultures societies and wider concerns. The child is the future of any nation, culture or society; what they read when young shapes the next generation both nationally and internationally.
Chinese Students' Expectations of Language Learning in Western Culture	This paper reports a small-scale study investigating Chinese students’ expectations of the teaching and learning techniques on a pre-sessional English language course at the University of Worcester. The preconceived view of the Chinese learner is one of passivity in English language classes in the UK, yet this research shows such behaviour does not signify lack of enthusiasm but rather lack of practice or possibly fear of losing face. Students were  aware of the techniques they would experience on the course and, in contrast to these Western preconceptions, were generally accepting and expectant of participative classroom behaviour.   However, those who had already been taught English by a native speaker showed greater awareness and acceptance of Western pedagogy. The personal attributes of the tutor, good teacher-student communication and a low-anxiety classroom environment were the factors they considered most conducive to good learning.
Prospects and Problems for Religious Education in England, 1967-1970: Curriculum Reform in Political Context	This article provides an historical case study of an abortive attempt to revise policy and legislation relating to Religious Education (RE) in English schools in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Drawing upon published sources, including parliamentary debates, as well as previously unutilised national archival sources from the Department of Education and Science, it comments upon events which have hitherto been omitted from the historiography of RE, but which help to contextualise significant changes in RE theory and practice at that time. Moreover, it demonstrates that the current parlous state of RE in schools is in part the result of latent and longstanding issues and problems, rather than a consequence of present-day government policy alone. Therefore, in reviewing and developing RE policies and practices, all stakeholders are urged to look more closely at both changes and continuities in the subject’s past and the contexts in which they occurred.
Understanding Engagement with the Privacy Domain Through Design Research.	This paper reports findings from participatory design research aimed at uncovering how technological interventions can engage users in the domain of privacy. Our work was undertaken in the context of a new design concept “Privacy Trends” whose aspiration is to foster technology users’ digital literacy regarding ongoing privacy risks and elucidate how such risks fit within existing social, organizational and political systems, leading to a longer term privacy concern. Our study reveals two challenges for privacy intervention design: the need to develop technology users’ intrinsic motivations with the privacy domain and the importance of framing the concept of privacy within users’ interests. Setting our study within a design context enables us to identify four design opportunities for fostering engagement with the privacy domain through technology design.
Genetic Differences in the Immediate Transcriptome Response to Stress Predict Risk-Related Brain Function and Psychiatric Disorders	Depression risk is exacerbated by genetic factors and stress exposure; however, the biological mechanisms through which these factors interact to confer depression risk are poorly understood. One putative biological mechanism implicates variability in the ability of cortisol, released in response to stress, to trigger a cascade of adaptive genomic and non-genomic processes through glucocorticoid receptor (GR) activation. Here, we demonstrate that common genetic variants in long-range enhancer elements modulate the immediate transcriptional response to GR activation in human blood cells. These functional genetic variants increase risk for depression and co-heritable psychiatric disorders. Moreover, these risk variants are associated with inappropriate amygdala reactivity, a transdiagnostic psychiatric endophenotype and an important stress hormone response trigger. Network modeling and animal experiments suggest that these genetic differences in GR-induced transcriptional activation may mediate the risk for depression and other psychiatric disorders by altering a network of functionally related stress-sensitive genes in blood and brain.
Perspectives on: Employability  Is it Time to Move the Employability Debate on?	The employability of our graduates has been a concern across the sector, and a subject of much debate, for a number of years. The increasing focus in more recent years can be seen as a management response to the growth in importance of the ‘Destination of Leavers of Higher Education’ (DLHE) process and its impact on league table rankings. However there is also a genuine concern amongst colleagues to do the best for their students and help them make a successful transition into the graduate labour market. The Chartered Association of Business Schools recently published a report “21st Century Leaders: building practice into the curriculum to boost employability” which shows that, if anything, employability issues are growing in prominence within businesses and business schools. The report also reveals that significant resources are being dedicated by business schools into supporting a range of initiatives, projects and research into boosting graduate employability.  The main purpose of this thought piece is to provoke a debate, and hopefully a sharing of practice, about employability amongst the Chartered ABS membership. The thought piece is not meant as a comprehensive review of the literature but highlights the main themes which have underpinned the employability debate over the last 15 to 20 years and suggests that a degree of consensus now exists within each of the themes. The central argument though is that the continuing work, and debate around these themes, has become sterile and repetitive. The thought piece therefore considers how work around employability can be moved on to a more productive stage. A number of areas are also suggested as being in urgent need of consideration by researchers, practitioners and institutional policy makers.
Book Review: Carmona M (ed.) (2014) Explorations in Urban Design: an Urban Design Research Primer, Farnham, Ashgate.	This paper examines some of the planed townscape changes affecting large city centre conservation areas and that have influenced policy through over twenty years of control. Data from local planning authority planning application files are used to identify the development trends in central conservation areas and the difficulties these pose for conservation policies. Detailed examination highlights the significant changes that can occur in central areas at the small scale, and some of the processes of change which remain largely unexamined by planning authorities. Identification of this ‘hidden’ change demonstrates the importance of monitoring at the small scale, and can identify key conservation ‘problems’ affecting these areas, including facadism, erosion of character and the weakness of local policies.
Autonomy as Both Challenge and Development in Clinical Education.	This study examines autonomy in learning, related to medical and health care students perception of learning and development in clinical education. An understanding of the ways in which students learning and professional development is facilitated by autonomy, and a qualitative different understanding of the concept is vital for future development of learning and teaching strategies in medical and health care education. Self-directed learning and management of the learning process have been, and still are, stressed within health care and medical education, thus paying less interest to internal processes of learning involving responsibility and independence. The aim of the study was to investigate the relationship between autonomy in learning and narratives of personal challenge and development in the context of student experiences in clinical education. The study was undertaken using narrative inquiry. Findings consist of four themes; Dependence of the clinical supervisor, Feelings of ambivalence, Professional becoming and Need for authenticity. Through our analysis of findings we suggest that autonomy should be regarded as something that develops in relation to others and not as a merely individual phenomenon and that an authentic clinical situation enhances students' experiences of autonomy.
A Hard Nut to Crack - Improving Primary Trainee Teacher Confidence in Teaching Physical Processes Topics.	This article puts forward a model of effective teacher training in primary science in the area of physical processes (highlighted as a potential area of concern in children’s learning, Ofsted 2011). Throughout their “learning journey” trainee teachers were encouraged to examine their own misconceptions and their awareness of children’s’ alternative frameworks. Before, during and after a six week teaching intervention, trainee teachers reflected upon their own ability to teach topics such as forces. Progress was monitored by trainee teacher written reflective responses to taught university sessions and a questionnaire designed to measure perceived teacher self-efficacy. It was found by using a multisensory, co-constructive training regime that perceived trainee teacher self-efficacy could be improved significantly, resulting in more confident trainee teachers.
Perceptions of Consent in Adolescents who Display Harmful Sexual Behaviour	This article will explore perceptions of consent in adolescents who display harmful sexual behaviour (HSB). Discussion on the constructions within society of the adolescent will be discussed in terms of emerging sexuality. Definitions of HSB will be examined in terms of adolescents and gender.   The terminology of consent, and what it means will be examined in depth in terms of the context in which it is referred and interventions explored that aim to tackle the issue of HSB and perceptions of consent in adolescence.
The Association Between Lower Educational Attainment and Depression Owing to Shared Genetic Effects? Results in ~25000 Subjects	An association between lower educational attainment (EA) and an increased risk for depression has been confirmed in various western countries. This study examines whether pleiotropic genetic effects contribute to this association. Therefore, data were analyzed from a total of 9662 major depressive disorder (MDD) cases and 14,949 controls (with no lifetime MDD diagnosis) from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium with additional Dutch and Estonian data. The association of EA and MDD was assessed with logistic regression in 15,138 individuals indicating a significantly negative association in our sample with an odds ratio for MDD 0.78 (0.75-0.82) per standard deviation increase in EA. With data of 884,105 autosomal common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), three methods were applied to test for pleiotropy between MDD and EA: (i) genetic profile risk scores (GPRS) derived from training data for EA (independent meta-analysis on ~120,000 subjects) and MDD (using a 10-fold leave-one-out procedure in the current sample), (ii) bivariate genomic-relationship-matrix restricted maximum likelihood (GREML) and (iii) SNP effect concordance analysis (SECA). With these methods, we found (i) that the EA-GPRS did not predict MDD status, and MDD-GPRS did not predict EA, (ii) a weak negative genetic correlation with bivariate GREML analyses, but this correlation was not consistently significant, (iii) no evidence for concordance of MDD and EA SNP effects with SECA analysis. To conclude, our study confirms an association of lower EA and MDD risk, but this association was not because of measurable pleiotropic genetic effects, which suggests that environmental factors could be involved, for example, socioeconomic status.
Sexual Abstinence and Young People: a Subject Worthy of Consideration?	A plethora of literature questions the UK’s approach to sexual health promotion, however, in contrast to the international literature there is a dearth of research which examines how young people in the UK feel about approaches to sexual health promotion which include  abstinence. This study, therefore, aims to explore whether young people feel that adequate emphasis is placed on delaying sexual intercourse in school-based sex education and whether they feel that abstinence is something that young people would be interested in  exploring. A total of 124 18–21-year-old students completed a two item open-ended questionnaire which encouraged them to reflect on their experiences and views regarding school-based sexual health promotion. Thematic analysis demonstrated a desire among young people for greater emphasis to be placed on abstinence as a sexual  health option within school-based sex and relationship education.
A System Dynamics Model to Predict Municipal Waste Generation and Management Costs in Developing Areas	This paper utilized system dynamics modeling as a new analytical approach to predict both the municipal waste generated and the associated disposal costs in developing areas. This approach facilitates the decomposition of general waste into its main components to enable municipalities to manage recyclables and find out the feasibility of performing recycling better rather than disposal by performing comparative disposal cost analysis. This study is different from previous work as it only considers population as a factor to predict the total waste generated and recycled, together with the associated expenditure and disposal cost savings.  The approach is verified by applying it to a case study in Nablus and demonstrates the evaluation of the quantity and composition of generated waste by considering population as the main influencing factor. The quantity and composition of municipal solid waste was evaluated to identify opportunities for waste recycling in the Nablus municipality. Municipal solid waste was collected and classified into eight main physical categories. The system dynamics model enable the quantity of each generated component such as plastic and metals to be anticipated together with the cost of recycling or disposal.
Something for Nothing? An Investigation into Online Product Sampling.	The application of websites to offer free samples of products and services to consumers is widespread.  Online approaches, including the use of “freebie” sites and social media, offer consumers free product samples by completing a request form.  However, this study demonstrates that a significant number of requests are ignored or unfulfilled.  Companies who fail to provide the requested samples, risk undermining the potential benefits of offering freebies online by creating customer dissatisfaction.
Risk Perception Influences Athletic Pacing Strategy.	PURPOSE:  To examine risk-taking and risk-perception associations with perceived exertion, pacing and performance in athletes.  METHODS:  Two experiments were conducted in which risk-perception was assessed using the domain-specific risk-taking (DOSPERT) scale in 20 novice cyclists (Experiment 1) and 32 experienced ultra-marathon runners (Experiment 2). In Experiment 1, participants predicted their pace and then performed a 5 km maximum effort cycling time-trial on a calibrated KingCycle mounted bicycle. Split-times and perceived exertion were recorded every kilometer. In experiment 2, each participant predicted their split times before running a 100 km ultra-marathon. Split-times and perceived exertion were recorded at 7 check-points. In both experiments, higher and lower risk-perception groups were created using median split of DOSPERT scores.  RESULTS:  In experiment 1, pace during the first km was faster among lower compared to higher risk-perceivers, t(18)=2.0 P=0.03, and faster among higher compared lower risk-takers, t(18)=2.2 P=0.02. Actual pace was slower than predicted pace during the first km in both the higher risk perceivers, t(9)=-4.2 P=0.001, and lower risk-perceivers, t(9)=-1.8 P=0.049. In experiment 2, pace during the first 36 km was faster among lower compared to higher risk-perceivers, t(16)=2.0 P=0.03. Irrespective of risk-perception group, actual pace was slower than predicted pace during the first 18 km, t(16)=8.9 P<0.001, and from 18 to 36 km, t(16)=4.0 P<0.001. In both experiments there was no difference in performance between higher and lower risk-perception groups.  CONCLUSIONS:  Initial pace is associated with an individual's perception of risk, with low perceptions of risk being associated with a faster starting pace. Large differences between predicted and actual pace suggests the performance template lacks accuracy, perhaps indicating greater reliance on momentary pacing decisions rather than pre-planned strategy.
Post-Crisis Belarus: Marxism and the Lender of Last Resort	Existing literature has examined the predictions and proscriptions of Karl Marx in response to the 2008 global financial crisis. However, the suggestions put forth by the Marxist-leaning literature never took hold and state-level banking and finance policies have remained largely unchanged. While many criticisms of Marxism exist, this paper examines Belarus, a ‘neo-communist’ or ‘market-socialist’ state, to provide a new perspective on the continuation of capitalism in the United States and Europe. In the case of Belarus, the International Monetary Fund and the Eurasian Economic Community's Anti-Crisis Fund provided both the critical liquidity needed to temporarily quell the effects of the financial crisis. Their demands meant that Belarus agreed to speed its move away from the Soviet-era finance and banking policies and more towards its western capitalist neighbors. Its failure to implement these policies further hurt its recovery. Examining Belarus' path to and out of its financial crisis makes apparent that the role of the international lender of last resort (LOLR). The LOLR acts as a key element in protecting states embroiled in the financial crisis from facing the possibility of making the difficult policy changes put forth by the Marxist literature. By ignoring its promises under the loan conditions from its LOLRs, Belarus moved further from the recovery promised by the Marxist suggestions.
A Prospective Review of Psychosocial  Functioning in Parents of Infants With Complex  Congenital Heart Disease Going Home For the  First Time Following First Stage Cardiac  Surgery	Aim: The study presented here prospectively explores psychosocial adaptation and adjustment in parents going home for the first time with their infants following first stage cardiac surgery for complex congenital heart disease (CHD). Preliminary review of psychosocial functioning (anxiety, depression and confidence) and parent demographics in 15 parents (12 mothers, 3 fathers of 12 infants) enrolled into a feasibility study exploring the efficacy of home monitoring for infants born with complex CHD, will be presented.  Method: Parents of infants being discharged from a specialist cardiac centre in the UK are recruited into a feasibility study, which commenced in August 2013 and ends in February 2015. The study is split into 3 randomisation arms:  Group A were discharged home with weighing scales, a saturation monitor and a Congenital Heart Assessment Tool (CHAT); Group B were discharged home  with the CHAT tool only and Group C were randomised to normal standard care. The parents are  interviewed at 4 time points: T0 before discharge, T1 2 weeks post discharge, T2 8 weeks post discharge  and T3 following the second surgical intervention (approximately 4-6 months post discharge). Baseline demographic data (family demographics, time of diagnosis, distance of specialist cardiac centre from home) is collected and parents are asked to complete the PHQ9, GAD7 and Maternal Confidence score (MCS) at each of the interviews.    Results: A preliminary review of the data collected from 15 parents, has demonstrated an improvement in anxiety, depression and confidence scores for all parents. Whereas some scores showed significant improvement a minority have shown a minimal increase in confidence scores. A more in depth analysis is currently being undertaken and these results will be available for display at the conference.  Conclusion: This is the first study of its kind to prospectively explore parents’ psychosocial adaptation and adjustment during the transition from hospital to home following first stage cardiac surgery. Despite the small number of families recruited into the study so far, the results provide an important insight into the discharge care and support these parents require. Implications for practice will be discussed.
Parents Experiences of Going Home With Their Infant Following First Stage Cardiac Surgery For Single Ventricle Heart	Aims: The study presented here retrospectively explored how parents felt about going home with their infants following first stage cardiac surgery for single ventricle heart.  Methods: Parents, all members of Little Hearts Matter (LHM, a UK Congenital Heart Disease Charity) completed an online questionnaire which asked about family demographics, time of diagnosis, location of specialist heart centre, distance from home, discharge information, social support, confidence, anxiety and how parents felt at the time of discharge (T0) and at the time of completing the questionnaire (T1). A non-experimental survey design was used; the questionnaire was structured so that both parents could answer the questions independently. 62 families with infants aged between 0-2 years were sent an email via LHM inviting them to complete the online questionnaire during Nov 2012. There were 22 responses (35% response rate) from 6 couples, 15 mothers and 1 father. Care had been received at 11 different specialist cardiac centres across the UK and 1 in Australia.  Results: The answers from the open ended questions which explored how parents felt about going home and their experiences were thematically analysed using an inductive approach. Five main themes arose: Mixed emotions ‘fear versus excitement’; the need for effective discharge preparation for parents; the need for effective discharge planning and preparation for community staff and local hospital teams; the need for access to information and advice (once home) and gaining control: the need to return to family functioning.  Conclusion: The study confirms anecdotal experiential evidence and has provided new insights into factors that may be associated with discharge from hospital to home for parents of infants with complex congenital heart disease. Implications for the review of children’s congenital cardiac services will be discussed specifically in relation to the discharge support role of ward nurses, children’s cardiac nurse specialists, psychologists and community teams.
London 2012 (Re)calling: Youth Memories and Olympic 'Legacy' Ether in the Hinterland	Engendering interest and support among young people was a key strategy for the organisers of the London 2012 Olympic Games. Part of the approach entailed promoting the event as a context and inspirational catalyst to propel young people’s proclivities toward, and enduring participation in, sport and physical activity. Although a variety of participatory platforms were entertained, the discipline of physical education remained a favoured space in which enduring Olympic imperatives could be amalgamated with government policy objectives. In this paper data are presented taken from the initial three years of a longitudinal study on young people’s engagement with the London 2012 Olympic Games, sport, physical activity and physical education within the UK’s West Midlands region. Memory scholarship is brought together with Olympic critiques, legacy debates, youth work and discussions about physical education to conceptualise participants’ anticipations and recollections of the London 2012 Olympic Games as a triptych of narrative fragments: each provides insights regarding youth experiences and the remnants of Olympic ether in the country’s hinterland. The paper offers a means subsequently to think differently about how we might play with the qualitative sociological/historiographical moments (experiences, voices, accounts, stories, etc.) that we capture in and through our work.
Encountering Anthropomorphism (Editorial)	On Anthropomorphism concerns itself with performances and artworks that explore the complex of interesting and mutually contradictory ideas located under the umbrella term, ‘anthropomorphism’. On the one hand, it is used to refer to something that resembles a human, and on the other hand it refers to our natural tendency to read human characteristics in the non-human object or animal. Moreover, an interrogation of the concept of anthropomorphism, especially as it is found in contemporary performance, suggests that there is not a singular line dividing the human from the non-human but a vast terrain that houses the comical, the uncanny and the abject. The aim of this issue is to elucidate anthropomorphism in its multitude of aspects, thereby shedding light on discourses around object theatre and ecological performance that attempt to understand the more-than-human world in a way that goes beyond ‘mere’ anthropomorphism.
Encountering the Spectre of Painting	When thinking what paintings are, I am continually brought back to my memory of a short sequence in Alfred Hitchcock’s Vertigo. In the scene, Kim Novak’s Madeleine is seated on a bench in an art gallery. She is apparently transfixed by a painting, Portrait of Carlotta. Alongside James Stewart, we watch her looking intently.     Madeleine is pretending to be a ghost. At this stage she does not expect us to believe she is a ghost, but simply to immerse ourselves in the conceit, to delight in the shudder. Madeleine’s back is turned away from us, and as the camera draws near to show that the knot pattern in her hair mirrors the image in the portrait, I imagine Madeleine suppressing a smile. She resolutely shows us her back, though, so her feint is not betrayed.    Madeleine’s stillness in this scene makes her appear as an object, a thing in the world, a rock or a pile of logs perhaps. We are not looking at that thing, however, but rather a residual image of something creaturely, a spectre. This after-image is held to the ground both by the gravity suggested by its manifestation and by the fine lie - the camouflage - of pretending to be a ghost.    Encountering a painting is like meeting Madeleine. It sits in front of its own picture, gazing at it. Despite being motionless and having its back to us, there is a lurching sensation the painting brings about by pretending to be the ghost of its picture, and, at the same time, never really anticipating your credulity.
The Importance of Emotional Intelligence in the Management of a Playwork Setting.	Our philosophy, as a manager and former manager of playwork settings, is that the most important resource in the setting is the people involved within it. James has managed a playwork setting for four years and Angela has managed a range of play settings during her twenty year career. At the beginning of our careers, we both believed that acquiring experience and knowledge of children and associated theory was the key to effective training and development. However as our careers developed, our opinions changed. Goleman’s (1996) work on Emotional Intelligence has had a significant impact on how James leads and supports his playwork team, and in this article we reflect on how an appreciation of emotional intelligence may produce more effective playwork practitioners
Rapid Cycling as a Feature of Bipolar Disorder and Comorbid Migraine	BACKGROUND:  Previous research has suggested the clinical profile of individuals with bipolar disorder (BD) differs according to the presence or absence of comorbid migraine. We aimed to determine the clinical characteristics that differentiate individuals with BD with and without comorbid migraine in a large, representative, clinically well-characterised UK sample.  METHODS:  The lifetime clinical characteristics of 1488 individuals with BD (BPI n=1120, BPII n=368) with and without comorbid migraine were compared (n=375 vs. n=1113 respectively).  RESULTS:  Individuals with BD and comorbid migraine had a distinctive set of lifetime clinical characteristics. A multivariate model showed that consistent with previous studies those with comorbid migraine were significantly more likely to be female (OR=2.099, p=0.005) and have comorbid panic attacks (OR=1.842, p=0.004). A novel finding was that even after controlling for other differences, the individuals with BD and comorbid migraine were more likely to have a rapid cycling illness course (OR=1.888, p=0.002).  LIMITATIONS:  Presence of migraine was assessed using self report measures. Cross-sectional study design limits investigations of bidirectional associations between migraine and bipolar disorder.  CONCLUSIONS:  Comorbid migraine in BD may represent a more homogenous subtype of BD with an unstable rapid cycling course. Identifying individuals with BD and comorbid migraine may be of use in a clinical setting and this subgroup could be the focus of future aetiological studies.
A Genetic Risk Score Combining 32 SNPs is Associated with Body Mass Index and Improves Obesity Prediction in People with Major Depressive Disorder	BACKGROUND: Obesity is strongly associated with major depressive disorder (MDD) and various other diseases. Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple risk loci robustly associated with body mass index (BMI). In this study, we aimed to investigate whether a genetic risk score (GRS) combining multiple BMI risk loci might have utility in prediction of obesity in patients with MDD.  METHODS: Linear and logistic regression models were conducted to predict BMI and obesity, respectively, in three independent large case-control studies of major depression (Radiant, GSK-Munich, PsyCoLaus). The analyses were first performed in the whole sample and then separately in depressed cases and controls. An unweighted GRS was calculated by summation of the number of risk alleles. A weighted GRS was calculated as the sum of risk alleles at each locus multiplied by their effect sizes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to compare the discriminatory ability of predictors of obesity.  RESULTS: In the discovery phase, a total of 2,521 participants (1,895 depressed patients and 626 controls) were included from the Radiant study. Both unweighted and weighted GRS were highly associated with BMI (P < 0.001) but explained only a modest amount of variance. Adding 'traditional' risk factors to GRS significantly improved the predictive ability with the area under the curve (AUC) in the ROC analysis, increasing from 0.58 to 0.66 (95% CI, 0.62-0.68; χ(2) = 27.68; P < 0.0001). Although there was no formal evidence of interaction between depression status and GRS, there was further improvement in AUC in the ROC analysis when depression status was added to the model (AUC = 0.71; 95% CI, 0.68-0.73; χ(2) = 28.64; P <0.0001). We further found that the GRS accounted for more variance of BMI in depressed patients than in healthy controls. Again, GRS discriminated obesity better in depressed patients compared to healthy controls. We later replicated these analyses in two independent samples (GSK-Munich and PsyCoLaus) and found similar results.  CONCLUSIONS:  A GRS proved to be a highly significant predictor of obesity in people with MDD but accounted for only modest amount of variance. Nevertheless, as more risk loci are identified, combining a GRS approach with information on non-genetic risk factors could become a useful strategy in identifying MDD patients at higher risk of developing obesity.
Increased Variability of Lap Speeds Differentiate Medallists and Non-Medallists in Middle Distance Running and Swimming Events.	Purpose: Previous literature has presented pacing data of groups of competition finalists. The aim of this study was to analyse the pacing patterns displayed by medallists and non-medallists in international competitive 400-m swimming and 1500-m running finals.  Methods: Split times were collected from 48 swimming finalists (four 100-m laps) and 60 running finalists (4 laps) in international competitions between 2004 and 2012. Using a cross sectional design, lap speeds were normalised to whole race speed and compared to identify variations of pace between groups of medallists and non-medallists. Lap speed variations relative to the gold medallist were compared for the whole field.  Results: In 400-m swimming the medallist group demonstrated greater variation in speed than the non-medallist group, being relatively faster in the final lap (p<0.001; moderate effect) and slower in laps one (p=0.03; moderate effect) and two (p>0.001; moderate effect). There were also greater variations of pace in the 1500-m running medallist group compared to the non-medallist group with a relatively faster final lap (p=0.03; moderate effect) and slower second lap (p=0.01; small effect). Swimming gold medallists were relatively faster than all other finalists in lap 4 (p=0.04) and running gold medallists were relatively faster than the 5th to 12th placed athletes in the final lap (p=0.02).  Conclusions: Athletes that win medals in 1500-m running and 400-m swimming competitions show different pacing patterns from non-medallists. End spurt speed increases are greater with medallists, who demonstrate a slower relative speed in the early part of races but a faster speed during the final part of races compared to non-medallists.
Why is it Important to Involve New Fathers in the Care of Their Child	Research into fathers’ unique contributions to the  physical, emotional, social and cognitive wellbeing of  their offspring has been ongoing for several decades.  Health and family care policy has focused increasingly  on the imperative to include fathers in services and  to see them as a vital resource for mothers and children.  The author identified papers from 2000 onwards that  illuminate health visitors’ level of engagement with  fathers of young families. The review covers policy  relating to health and family services for fathers,  the nature of fathering in the 21st century, the influence  of involved fathers on their partners and babies, what  fathers say they want from family services, and future  directions for research into fathering.
Pediatric Oncology Palliative Care: Experiences of General Practitioners and Bereaved Parents	Objective: This qualitative study set in the West Midlands region of the United Kingdom, aimed to examine the  role of the general practitioner (GP) in children's oncology palliative care from the perspective of GPs who had cared for a child with cancer receiving palliative care at home and bereaved parents.  Methods: One-to-one semi-structured interviews were undertaken with 18 GPs and 11 bereaved parents  following the death. A grounded theory data analysis was undertaken; identifying generated themes through  chronological comparative data analysis.  Results: Similarity in GP and parent viewpoints was found, the GPs role seen as one of providing medication and  support. Time pressures GPs faced influenced their level of engagement with the family during palliative and  bereavement care and their ability to address their identified learning deficits. Lack of familiarity with the family, coupled with an acknowledgment that it was a rare and could be a frightening experience, also influenced their level of interaction. There was no consistency in GP practice nor evidence of practice being guided by local or national policies. Parents lack of clarity of their GPs role resulted in missed opportunities for support.  Conclusions: Time pressures influence GP working practices. Enhanced communication and collaboration  between the GP and regional childhood cancer centre may help address identified GP challenges, such as learning  deficits, and promote more time-efficient working practices through role clarity. Parents need greater awareness of  their GP's wide-ranging role; one that transcends palliative care incorporating bereavement support and on-going medical care for family members
An Exploration of the Data Collection Methods Utilised with Children, Teenagers and Young People (CTYPs)	Background: The impact of cancer upon children, teenagers and young people can be profound. Research has  been undertaken to explore the impacts upon children, teenagers and young people with cancer, but little is  known about how researchers can ‘best’ engage with this group to explore their experiences. This review paper  provides an overview of the utility of data collection methods employed when undertaking research with children,  teenagers and young people.  A systematic review of relevant databases was undertaken utilising the search terms ‘young people’, ‘young adult’,  ‘adolescent’ and ‘data collection methods’. The full-text of the papers that were deemed eligible from the title and  abstract were accessed and following discussion within the research team, thirty papers were included.  Findings: Due to the heterogeneity in terms of the scope of the papers identified the following data collections  methods were included in the results section. Three of the papers identified provided an overview of data  collection methods utilised with this population and the remaining twenty seven papers covered the following  data collection methods: Digital technologies; art based research; comparing the use of ‘paper and pencil’ research  with web-based technologies, the use of games; the use of a specific communication tool; questionnaires and interviews; focus groups and telephone interviews/questionnaires.  The strengths and limitations of the range of data collection methods included are discussed drawing upon such  issues as of the appropriateness of particular methods for particular age groups, or the most appropriate method to  employ when exploring a particularly sensitive topic area.  Conclusions: There are a number of data collection methods utilised to undertaken research with children, teenagers and young adults. This review provides a summary of the current available evidence and an overview of the strengths and limitations of data collection methods employed.
The Enthusiast’s Eye: The Value of Unsanctioned Knowledge in Design Historical Scholarship	If design history research relies solely on institutionalized documentation and academic scholarship – that is, sanctioned knowledge – not only will its purview be limited to a very narrow segment of design culture, it will also lose out on a vast array of sources to valuable knowledge about our material environment produced by amateurs, collectors, and enthusiasts – what we in this article define as “unsanctioned knowledge.” Because of its dissociation with professional institutions and academic protocols and their – albeit admittedly utopian, but nonetheless upheld – ideals of objectivity, this type of knowledge is typically considered fundamentally subjective in nature and therefore of little or no relevance and value to academic scholarship. In this article, we argue that, to the contrary, design historical scholarship has much to gain from engaging more seriously with the unsanctioned knowledge represented by the enthusiast's eye.
Mentors: Supporting Learning to Improve Patient Care	Mentorship is becoming an important aspect of professional development among all healthcare professionals. What was once understood as purely the domain of nurse registrants in teaching and assessing student nurses is now being considered to support healthcare assistants (HCAs) in their professional development. This article introduces some of the benefits of mentorship for HCAs and how this can ultimately improve care delivery.
Developing the Next Generation of Entrepreneurs: Giving Students the Opportunity to Gain Experience and Thrive	Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) have increasingly utilized experiential approaches in business education; however, some researchers have suggested that further research is required to investigate the effectiveness and student reaction to such approaches. The aim of this study is to determine the impact of an experiential learning approach on the perceived development of entrepreneurial traits and to measure the level of both student engagement and satisfaction. The approach was designed and tested during a Higher National Diploma (HND) entrepreneurship module in a British HEI. Traditional taught sessions were blended with applied activities that required students to utilize the skills they learned to complete steps of the activities, which increased in length and complexity. Results found both a high level of student satisfaction and engagement and the belief that the module’s experiential approach had, in many instances, helped to develop entrepreneurial traits. Successful practice and modifications are discussed.

The Effects of Being in a “New Relationship” on Levels of Testosterone in Men.	In light of previous research showing that different types of relationships affect levels of testosterone in men, this study examined whether categorizing relationship types according to relationship length can shed further light on variations in levels of testosterone. Salivary testosterone samples were obtained from a sample of men and details about their relationship status, sociosexual orientation, extra-pair sexual interest, and their perceptions of their relationships were recorded. Using a median split analysis, participants who indicated that they had been in their relationship for less than 12 months were categorized as being in “new relationships” and those in longer relationships being categorized as in long-term relationships. Results showed that levels of testosterone of single men and men in new relationships did not differ, but both had significantly greater levels of testosterone than men in long-term relationships. Differences in levels of testosterone were unrelated to sociosexual orientation and extra-pair sexual interest. These findings support the evolutionary explanation of levels of testosterone in men varying in accordance with their internal motivation to seek new potential mates.
Perceived Coach Behavior in Training and Competition Predicts Collective Efficacy in Female Elite Handball Players	The purpose of the present study was to explore the relationships between athletes’ perceived coach behaviors during training and competition, and collective efficacy. Elite female handball players in Norway (N = 113) completed the Leadership Scale for Sport (LSS), the Coaching Behavior Questionnaire (CBQ), and the Collective Efficacy Questionnaire for Sports (CEQS). Relationships were identified between perceived coach behaviors in training and competition environments and with athlete collective efficacy. Hierarchical multiple regression analyses revealed  that prediction of variance in collective efficacy improved when perceptions of coach behaviour during competition were entered in addition to perceptions of coach leadership behavior during training. Furthermore, the results indicated that greater levels of perceived training and instructional behavior, positive feedback, social support, and supportiveness predicted greater collective efficacy. In contrast, higher perception of negative activation predicted lower levels of collective efficacy. The results highlight the important relationships between coach behavior inboth training and competition, and their combined impact upon collective efficacy in elite female handball teams.
Inter-instrument Reliability of the Actigraph GT3X+ Ambulatory Activity Monitor During Free-living Conditions in Adults	Background: Currently, no studies have investigated inter-instrument reliability of the ActiGraph (AG) GT3X+ in free-living conditions. Methods: Nineteen adults (11 males, 8 females; aged 36.8 ? 11.9 years) wore a pair of AG?s (one on each hip), during all waking hours for one day. Raw outputs were generated for total counts, steps, wear time and mean counts per minute. Intensity outputs were derived for time (minutes) spent in <moderate, moderate, vigorous, very vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA). Intraclass correlation (ICC), absolute percent difference (APD), coefficient of variation (CV), Bland-Altman plots and paired t-tests were used to evaluate reliability. Results: Inter- instrument reliability was high (CV<5) for raw count and derived intensity outputs, except vigorous and very vigorous activity. ICC, CV and APD values for vigorous and very vigorous were .97, 12.28, 17.36 and .98, 18.15, 25.67 respectively. Amalgamating moderate, vigorous and very vigorous into a single MVPA category reduced the CV and APD values to 2.85 and 4.02, and increased the ICC value to .99. No significant differences were found between contralateral units for any outputs (p>0.05). Conclusion: Reliability decreases beyond moderate intensities. MVPA displays superior inter-instrument reliability than individual intensity categories. Research question permitting, reporting time in MVPA may maximise reliability.
Evidence for the Effectiveness of Holistic Process Goals for Learning and Performance Under Pressure	Objectives    Research has suggested that holistic process goals might help avoid the effects associated with conscious processing of task relevant information by skilled but anxious athletes. This experiment compared the efficacy of holistic and part process goal strategies for novices using a learning paradigm.  Design    Laboratory-based experimental design incorporating practice, retention and transfer phases.  Method    Twenty-four males were randomly assigned to a part process goal, holistic process goal or control condition and performed a simulated race-driving task in practice, retention and transfer tests.  Results    Analyses of variance revealed that performance during practice was similar in all conditions but that the holistic process goal group outperformed the part process goal group at both retention and transfer.  Conclusions    Compared to part process goals, holistic process goals result in more effective motor learning and performance that appears to be more robust under pressure.
Foundation Doctors and Dyslexia: a Qualitative Study  of Their Experiences and Coping Strategies	Background Dyslexia is the most common form of  specific learning difficulty affecting approximately 6% of  the general UK population and believed to affect  approximately 2% of UK medical students. The impact  of dyslexia on early practice has not been studied.  Objectives To develop an understanding of the  challenges faced by doctors with dyslexia in the first year  of practice and their support requirements.  Methods Semistructured telephone interviews were  conducted with seven foundation year 1 doctors with  dyslexia from Scottish hospitals between March 2013  and August 2013.  Results Foundation doctors indicated that due to their  dyslexia, they experience difficulty with all forms of  communication, time management and anxiety. There  were concerns about disclosure of their dyslexia to  colleagues and supervisors. Coping strategies used  frequently were safety-netting and planning; technology  solutions did offer some assistance.  Conclusions Although technological interventions have  the potential to offer benefits to foundation doctors with  dyslexia, increased openness about a diagnosis of  dyslexia with discussion between doctor and supervisors  about the challenges and anxieties is likely to provide  the most benefit
Adverse Childhood Events and Psychosis in Bipolar Affective Disorder	BACKGROUND:  There has been increasing interest in the association between childhood trauma and psychosis. Proposals for potential mechanisms involved include affective dysregulation and cognitive appraisals of threat.  AIMS:  To establish if, within bipolar disorder, childhood events show a significant association with psychosis, and in particular with symptoms driven by dysregulation of mood or with a persecutory content.  METHOD:  Data on lifetime-ever presence of psychotic symptoms were determined by detailed structured interview with case-note review (n = 2019). Childhood events were recorded using a self-report questionnaire and case-note information.  RESULTS:  There was no relationship between childhood events, or childhood abuse, and psychosis per se. Childhood events were not associated with an increased risk of persecutory or other delusions. Significant associations were found between childhood abuse and auditory hallucinations, strongest between sexual abuse and mood congruent or abusive voices. These relationships remain significant even after controlling for lifetime-ever cannabis misuse.  CONCLUSIONS:  Within affective disorder, the relationship between childhood events and psychosis appears to be relatively symptom-specific. It is possible that the pathways leading to psychotic symptoms differ, with delusions and non-hallucinatory symptoms being influenced less by childhood or early environmental experience.
Age and Grip Strength Predict Hand Dexterity in Adults.	In the scientific literature, there is much evidence of a relationship between age and dexterity,  where increased age is related to slower, less nimble and less smooth, less coordinated  and less controlled performances. While some suggest that the relationship is a direct consequence  of reduced muscle strength associated to increased age, there is a lack of research  that has systematically investigated the relationships between age, strength and  hand dexterity. Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the associations between  age, grip strength and dexterity. 107 adults (range 18-93 years) completed a series of hand  dexterity tasks (i.e. steadiness, line tracking, aiming, and tapping) and a test of maximal grip  strength. We performed three phases of analyses. Firstly, we evaluated the simple relationships  between pairs of variables; replicating the existing literature; and found significant relationships  of increased age and reduced strength; increased age and reduced dexterity,  and; reduced strength and reduced dexterity. Secondly, we used standard Multiple Regression  (MR) models to determine which of the age and strength factors accounted for the  greater variance in dexterity. The results showed that both age and strength made significant  contributions to the data variance, but that age explained more of the variance in  steadiness and line tracking dexterity, whereas strength explained more of the variance in  aiming and tapping dexterity. In a third phase of analysis, we used MR analyses to show an  interaction between age and strength on steadiness hand dexterity. Simple Slopes posthoc  analyses showed that the interaction was explained by the middle to older aged adults  showing a relationship between reduced strength and reduced hand steadiness, whereas  younger aged adults showed no relationship between strength and steadiness hand dexterity.  The results are discussed in terms of how age and grip strength predict different types of  hand dexterity in adults.
Evaluation of a Brief Intervention to Assist Health Visitors and Community Practitioners to Engage with Fathers as Part of the Healthy Child Initiative	Aims: To improve engagement of Health Visitors and Community Practitioners delivering the Healthy Child Programme with fathers. To evaluate a one-day, father-focused workshop with a supporting handbook for Practitioners. To identify institutional and organisational barriers to engagement with fathers.    Background: The UK government policy encourages health professionals to engage with fathers. This derives from robust evidence that fathers’ early involvement with their children impacts positively on emotional, behavioural and educational development. Yet, there is little evidence that the importance of engaging fathers is reflected in Health Visitor training or that primary-care services are wholly embracing father-inclusive practice. The Fatherhood Institute (FI), a UK charity, has developed a workshop for Practitioners delivering the Healthy Child Programme.    Method: A ‘before and after’ evaluation study, comprising a survey followed by telephone interviews, evaluated the impact of the FI workshop on Health Visitors’ and Community Practitioners’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in practice. A total of 134 Health Visitors and Community Practitioners from eight NHS Trusts in England attended the workshop from November 2011 to January 2014 at 12 sites. A specially constructed survey, incorporating a validated questionnaire, was administered before the workshop, immediately afterwards and three months later. Telephone interviews further explored participants’ responses.    Findings: Analysis of the questionnaire data showed that the workshop and handbook improved participants’ knowledge, attitudes and behaviour in practice. This was sustained over a three-month period. In telephone interviews, most participants said that the workshop had raised their awareness of engaging fathers and offered them helpful strategies. However, they also spoke of barriers to engagement with fathers. NHS Trusts need to review the training and education of Health Visitors and Community Practitioners and take a more strategic approach towards father-inclusive practice and extend services to meet the needs of fathers.
The Relationship Between Interleukin-6 in Saliva, Venous and Capillary Plasma, at Rest and in Response to Exercise	IL-6 plays a mechanistic role in conditions such as metabolic syndrome, chronic fatigue syndrome and clinical depression and also plays a major role in inflammatory and immune responses to exercise. The purpose of this study was to investigate the levels of resting and post exercise IL-6 when measured in venous plasma, saliva and capillary plasma. Five male and five females completed 2 separate exercise trials, both of which involved standardized exercise sessions on a cycle ergometer. Venous blood and saliva samples were taken immediately before and after Trial A, venous and capillary blood samples were taken immediately before and after Trial B. IL-6 values were obtained using a high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In Trial A venous plasma IL-6 increased significantly from 0.4. 0.14. pg/ml to 0.99 0.29. pg/ml (. P<. 0.01) while there was no increase in salivary IL-6. Venous plasma and salivary IL-6 responses were not correlated at rest, post exercise or when expressed as an exercise induced change. In Trial B venous and capillary plasma IL-6 increased significantly (venous: 0.22. Â±. 0.18 to 0.74. Â±. 0.28. pg/ml; capillary: 0.37. Â±. 0.22 to 1.08. Â±. 0.30. pg/ml (. P<. 0.01). Venous and capillary plasma responses did not correlate at rest (. r=. 0.59, P=. 0.07) but did correlate post exercise (. r=. 0.79) and when expressed as an exercise induced change (. r=. 0.71, P=. 0.02). Saliva does not appear to reflect systemic IL-6 responses, either at rest or in response to exercise. Conversely, capillary plasma responses are reflective of systemic IL-6 responses to exercise.

Educating Gratitude: Some Conceptual and Moral Misgivings	In a rapidly expanding academic literature on gratitude, psychologists, philosophers and educational theorists have argued that gratitude is not just of great psycho-social importance but also of moral significance. It would therefore seem to follow that the promotion of gratitude is also of moral educational significance. In this regard, recent attempts by psychologists to develop practical interventions designed to make people more grateful should be of some interest. However, while appreciating some benefits of such work, the present paper argues that much of it falls short of the educational task of developing an adequate pedagogy of gratitude focused on assisting learners’ acquaintance with the complex normative grammar (moral and conceptual) of gratitude discourse. With reference to ongoing work by the authors, the paper proceeds to explore further this important dimension of educating gratitude.
Seasonality Shows Evidence for Polygenic Architecture and Genetic Correlation With Schizophrenia and Bipolar Disorder	OBJECTIVE:  To test common genetic variants for association with seasonality (seasonal changes in mood and behavior) and to investigate whether there are shared genetic risk factors between psychiatric disorders and seasonality.  METHOD:  Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) were conducted in Australian (between 1988 and 1990 and between 2010 and 2013) and Amish (between May 2010 and December 2011) samples in whom the Seasonal Pattern Assessment Questionnaire (SPAQ) had been administered, and the results were meta-analyzed in a total sample of 4,156 individuals. Genetic risk scores based on results from prior large GWAS studies of bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder (MDD), and schizophrenia were calculated to test for overlap in risk between psychiatric disorders and seasonality.  RESULTS:  The most significant association was with rs11825064 (P = 1.7 × 10⁻⁶, β = 0.64, standard error = 0.13), an intergenic single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) found on chromosome 11. The evidence for overlap in risk factors was strongest for schizophrenia and seasonality, with the schizophrenia genetic profile scores explaining 3% of the variance in log-transformed global seasonality scores. Bipolar disorder genetic profile scores were also associated with seasonality, although at much weaker levels (minimum P value = 3.4 × 10⁻³), and no evidence for overlap in risk was detected between MDD and seasonality.  CONCLUSIONS:  Common SNPs of large effect most likely do not exist for seasonality in the populations examined. As expected, there were overlapping genetic risk factors for bipolar disorder (but not MDD) with seasonality. Unexpectedly, the risk for schizophrenia and seasonality had the largest overlap, an unprecedented finding that requires replication in other populations and has potential clinical implications considering overlapping cognitive deficits in seasonal affective disorders and schizophrenia.
Hydrophobic and Charged Residues in the C-Terminal Arm of Hepatitis C Virus RNA-Dependent RNA Polymerase Regulate Initiation and Elongation.	The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) of hepatitis C virus (HCV) is essential for viral genome replication. Crystal structures of the HCV RdRp reveal two C-terminal features, a β-loop and a C-terminal arm, suitably located for involvement in positioning components of the initiation complex. Here we show that these two elements intimately regulate template and nucleotide binding, initiation, and elongation. We constructed a series of β-loop and C-terminal arm mutants, which were used for in vitro analysis of RdRp de novo initiation and primer extension activities. All mutants showed a substantial decrease in initiation activities but a marked increase in primer extension activities, indicating an ability to form more stable elongation complexes with long primer-template RNAs. Structural studies of the mutants indicated that these enzyme properties might be attributed to an increased flexibility in the C-terminal features resulting in a more open polymerase cleft, which likely favors the elongation process but hampers the initiation steps. A UTP cocrystal structure of one mutant shows, in contrast to the wild-type protein, several alternate conformations of the substrate, confirming that even subtle changes in the C-terminal arm result in a more loosely organized active site and flexible binding modes of the nucleotide. We used a subgenomic replicon system to assess the effects of the same mutations on viral replication in cells. Even the subtlest mutations either severely impaired or completely abolished the ability of the replicon to replicate, further supporting the concept that the correct positioning of both the β-loop and C-terminal arm plays an essential role during initiation and in HCV replication in general.  IMPORTANCE:  HCV RNA polymerase is a key target for the development of directly acting agents to cure HCV infections, which necessitates a thorough understanding of the functional roles of the various structural features of the RdRp. Here we show that even highly conservative changes, e.g., Tyr→Phe or Asp→Glu, in these seemingly peripheral structural features have profound effects on the initiation and elongation properties of the HCV polymerase.
Acute Postexercise Effects of Concentric and Eccentric Exercise on Glucose Tolerance	Impaired glucose tolerance was shown to be present 48 hr following muscle-damaging eccentric exercise. We examined the acute effect of concentric and muscle-damaging eccentric exercise, matched for intensity, on the responses to a 2-hr 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). Ten men (27 ± 9 years, 178 ± 7 cm, 75 ± 11 kg, VO₂max: 52.3 ± 7.3 ml · kg⁻¹ · min⁻¹) underwent three OGTTs after an overnight 12 hr fast: rest (control), 40-min (5 × 8-min with 2-min interbout rest) of concentric (level running, 0%, CON) or eccentric exercise (downhill running, -12%, ECC). Running intensity was matched at 60% of maximal metabolic equivalent. Maximal isometric force of m. quadriceps femoris of both legs was measured before and after the running protocols. Downhill running speed was higher (level: 9.7 ± 2.1, downhill: 13.8 ± 3.2 km · hr⁻¹, p < .01). Running protocols had similar VO₂max (p = .59), heart rates (p = .20) and respiratory exchange ratio values (p = .74) indicating matched intensity and metabolic demands. Downhill running resulted in higher isometric force deficits (level: 3.0 ± 6.7, downhill: 17.1 ± 7.3%, p < .01). During OGTTs, area-under-the-curve for plasma glucose (control: 724 ± 97, CON: 710 ± 77, ECC: 726 ± 72 mmol · L⁻¹ · 120 min, p = .86) and insulin (control: 24995 ± 11229, CON: 23319 ± 10417, ECC: 21842 ± 10171 pmol · L⁻¹ · 120 min, p = .48), peak glucose (control: 8.1 ± 1.3, CON: 7.7 ± 1.2, ECC: 7.7 ± 1.1 mmol · L⁻¹, p = .63) and peak insulin levels (control: 361 ± 188, CON: 322 ± 179, ECC: 299 ± 152 pmol · L⁻¹, p = .30) were similar. It was concluded that glucose tolerance and the insulin response to an OGTT were not changed immediately by muscle-damaging eccentric exercise.
Evidence of an Alternative Currency for Altruism in Laboratory-Based Experiments	Research shows that altruistic behaviours arise in varying social situations in line with different theories of causes of such behaviours. However most research uses financial costs only, which makes our understanding of altruism currently limited. This study presents findings of three experiments that use a novel and simple laboratory-based task that measures altruism based on the amount of time participants are willing to spend as a cost to help others. This task assessed two specific theories; altruistic punishment (Experiments 1 & 2) and empathy-altruism (Experiment 3). All experiments showed that the task was successful, as participants were more likely to altruistically punish violators of social contracts than other scenarios (Experiments 1 and 2), and also incur more costs to behave altruistically towards others when feeling empathic than different emotional states (Experiment 3). These results provide clear support for the use and value of this novel task in future research.
Joint Analysis of Psychiatric Disorders Increases Accuracy of Risk Prediction for Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Major Depressive Disorder	Genetic risk prediction has several potential applications in medical research and clinical practice and could be used, for example, to stratify a heterogeneous population of patients by their predicted genetic risk. However, for polygenic traits, such as psychiatric disorders, the accuracy of risk prediction is low. Here we use a multivariate linear mixed model and apply multi-trait genomic best linear unbiased prediction for genetic risk prediction. This method exploits correlations between disorders and simultaneously evaluates individual risk for each disorder. We show that the multivariate approach significantly increases the prediction accuracy for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder in the discovery as well as in independent validation datasets. By grouping SNPs based on genome annotation and fitting multiple random effects, we show that the prediction accuracy could be further improved. The gain in prediction accuracy of the multivariate approach is equivalent to an increase in sample size of 34% for schizophrenia, 68% for bipolar disorder, and 76% for major depressive disorders using single trait models. Because our approach can be readily applied to any number of GWAS datasets of correlated traits, it is a flexible and powerful tool to maximize prediction accuracy. With current sample size, risk predictors are not useful in a clinical setting but already are a valuable research tool, for example in experimental designs comparing cases with high and low polygenic risk.
Psychiatric Genome-wide Association Study Analyses Implicate Neuronal, Immune and Histone Pathways	Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of psychiatric disorders have identified multiple genetic associations with such disorders, but better methods are needed to derive the underlying biological mechanisms that these signals indicate. We sought to identify biological pathways in GWAS data from over 60,000 participants from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium. We developed an analysis framework to rank pathways that requires only summary statistics. We combined this score across disorders to find common pathways across three adult psychiatric disorders: schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. Histone methylation processes showed the strongest association, and we also found statistically significant evidence for associations with multiple immune and neuronal signaling pathways and with the postsynaptic density. Our study indicates that risk variants for psychiatric disorders aggregate in particular biological pathways and that these pathways are frequently shared between disorders. Our results confirm known mechanisms and suggest several novel insights into the etiology of psychiatric disorders.
Transition Time.	After more than six years of consultation, 1 January 2015  marked the largest change in the UK accounting profession for decades.  Many of us felt saddened to see the old statements of standard accounting practice (SSAPs) and financial reporting standards (FRSs) that we knew and loved become but a distant memory. However, in its place FRS 102 promises a simplified reporting regime with more up-todate and relevant accounting requirements that are less complex and onerous for SMEs. One of the most significant changes, which will apply to most businesses, is in respect of accounting for leases.

Who Can Blame Who for What and How in Responsibility  for Health?	This paper starts by introducing a tripartite conception of responsibility for health consisting of a moral agent having moral responsibilities and being held responsible, that is blamed, for failing to meet them and proceeds to a brief discussion of the nature of blame, noting difficulties in agency and obligation when the concept is applied to health threatening behaviours.  Insights about the obligations that we hold people to and the extent of their moral agency are revealed by interrogating our blaming behaviour, and to facilitate this my own blaming attitudes and actions are analysed in respect of an imagined adult son who seeks thrills by jumping from a pier into the sea, an activity common around coastlines and intended to be analogous in varying degrees to a range of health-threatening behaviours. I consider my responses to this imagined act in relation to some features of moralism, the excess of morality, concluding that blame can be justified when it is proportionate and within interpersonal relationships. There is evidence that some nurses hold negative blaming attitudes towards groups of patients considered to have caused or contributed to their illness, but this is not justified, not only because of impaired agency, but because if there is responsibility for health, associated obligations are owed to those who share our lives, and it is those people who are entitled to hold individuals responsible.  Nurses who hold negative blaming attitudes towards groups of patients are invited to identify the status of moral agency, the precise natures of their (failed) obligations and of the patient / nurse relationship. It is concluded that reflection on these matters, and the difference between justified blame and moralism demonstrates that blaming behaviour in the context of professional health care is built on nothing stronger than prejudice.
Mediatizing Childhood Religion: the BBC, John G. Williams, and Collective Worship for Schools in England, c.1940-1975	As part of its stated mission to Christianise Britain, from its earliest years the BBC broadcast religious programmes intended for a child audience. Directed at sites domestic and educational, these broadcasts constituted a means of the mediatisation of religion for children. This paper explores the work of the pioneer children’s religious broadcaster John G. Williams, the nature and character of childhood religion and its nurture espoused by him whilst at the BBC, and as an educationist in the years following the 1944 Education Act. Setting a close reading of Williams’ views on childhood religion and school worship alongside those of a later critique, from the religious educationist John Hull in his School Worship: An Obituary (1975), this article argues that the differences between these two religious educators illustrate fracture lines occurring between religious education in the home, school and broadcast spaces in the long 1960s. Additionally, the historical evidence presented here provides a nuanced understanding of mediatisation as a process, indicating that other social processes in any national context, for example de-Christianisation in the English one, disrupt media logic. Finally, further research is called for on the historical intersections of religious education, and schools and religious broadcasting, as well as the more recent effects of broadcast collective worship in mediatising religion for children.
Effect of Level and Downhill Running on Breathing Efficiency	Ventilatory equivalents for oxygen and carbon dioxide are physiological measures of breathing efficiency, and are known to be affected by the intensity and mode of exercise. We examined the effect of level running (gradient 0%) and muscle-damaging downhill running (?12%), matched for oxygen uptake, on the ventilatory equivalents for oxygen () and carbon dioxide (). Nine men (27 ± 9 years, 179 ± 7 cm, 75 ± 12 kg, : 52.0 ± 7.7 mL·kg?1·min?1) completed two 40-min running bouts (5 × 8-min with 2-min inter-bout rest), one level and one downhill. Running intensity was matched at 60% of maximal metabolic equivalent. Maximal isometric force of m.quadriceps femoris was measured before and after the running bouts. Data was analyzed with 2-way ANOVA or paired samples t-tests. Running speed (downhill: 13.5 ± 3.2, level: 9.6 ± 2.2 km·h?1) and isometric force deficits (downhill: 17.2 ± 7.6%, level: 2.0 ± 6.9%) were higher for downhill running. Running bouts for level and downhill gradients had , heart rates and respiratory exchange ratio values that were not different indicating matched intensity and metabolic demands. During downhill running, the , (downhill: 29.7 ± 3.3, level: 27.2 ± 1.6) and (downhill: 33.3 ± 2.7, level: 30.4 ± 1.9) were 7.1% and 8.3% higher (p < 0.05) than level running. In conclusion, breathing efficiency appears lower during downhill running (i.e., muscle-damaging exercise) compared to level running at a similar moderate intensity.
Understanding ‘Cyberchondria’: an Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis of the Purpose, Methods and Impact of Seeking Health Information Online for those with Health Anxiety	‘Cyberchondria’ describes the phenomenon of searching for health information online exacerbating health anxiety. This study explores health anxious individuals’ experiences of searching for health information online to further understand ‘cyberchondria’. Semi-structured interviews were used to explore participants’ (N = 8) experiences of searching for health information online. Transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. Four themes emerged:  ‘information is power’, ‘novelty of Internet searching’, ‘need for strategies to navigate the search: Google, authority and cross-checking’, and ‘cyberchondria: short-term gain but long-term pain’. Participants’ accounts suggested they sought health information online as a form of problem solving: to understand their problem and decide on a strategy for solving it, to feel better about having the problem by having ‘done something’ about it, or to share others’ similar experiences. Seeking online health  information was prompted by negative expectations of healthcare professionals, yet was not seen as a replacement for medical consultations. Participants noted the accessibility of the Internet and were aware that information is sometimes inaccurate or irrelevant.  Thus participants used strategies to ﬁlter and validate information. The ﬁndings are considered in relation to what they tell us about the purpose, methods and impact of  seeking health information online among individuals with health anxiety.
Linkages between Reach-scale Physical Habitat and Invertebrate Assemblages in Upland Streams	Determining the influence of physical habitat on biological structure in minimally disturbed settings is important if the effects of alterations to physical habitat are to be understood. This study tested whether reach-scale differences in physical habitat influence macroinvertebrate community composition at 24 sites in the Cairngorm Mountains, Scotland. Stream reaches were classified into channel types based on a geomorphic typology (i.e. step-pool, bedrock, plane-bed and pool-riffle). PERMANOVA indicated an overall significant relationship between the geomorphic typology and macroinvertebrate species-level composition, and among all combinations of channel types (such as step-pool and pool-riffle, step-pool and bedrock). Most channel types were dominated by high abundances of Baetis rhodani, Rhithrogena semicolorata and Leuctra inermis, which are ubiquitous in unpolluted gravel-bedded Scottish streams. However, reflecting significant differences in abundance of commoner taxa between types, indicator value (IndVal) analysis revealed that pool-riffle reaches were characterised by elmids (Limnius sp. and Oulimnius sp.) and Caenis rivulorum, and step-pool reaches by Alainites muticus, B. rhodani, L. inermis and Brachyptera risi. Geomorphic typing of rivers provides a useful basis for the initial assessment of ecological status whereas abundance-based biological data processed at the appropriate taxonomic resolution should be sensitive to physical-habitat modifications.
An In-depth Appraisal of Career Termination Experiences in Elite Cricket.	This qualitative study explored the career termination experiences of 9 male, retired professional cricketers, between the ages of 28 to 40 (M = 34, SD = 4.65). The participants took part in retrospective, semi-structured interviews. Data from the interviews were inductively content analysed within three transition phases of the retirement process: reasons for retirement, factors affecting adaptation, and reactions to retirement. The reasons for retirement were multicausal with the majority of the participants highlighting contractual pressures and a lack of communication as important precursors to retirement. Three main themes accounted for the factors affecting adaptation: a limited pursuit of other interests, developmental experiences and coping strategies. In terms of reactions to retirement, all of the participants reflected negatively on the termination of their career, with a sense of loss and resentment characterising the post-retirement period. The findings illustrated the sport-specific nature of career termination in professional cricket, and added further support to the emerging consensus that the distinction between voluntary and involuntary retirement is, at best, unclear.
Involvement of the Electrophilic Isothiocyanate Sulforaphane in Arabidopsis Local Defense Responses	Plants defend themselves against microbial pathogens through a range of highly sophisticated and integrated molecular systems. Recognition of pathogen-secreted effector proteins often triggers the hypersensitive response (HR), a complex multicellular defense reaction where programmed cell death (PCD) of cells surrounding the primary site of infection is a prominent feature. Even though the HR was described almost a century ago, cell to cell factors acting at the local level generating the full defense reaction has remained obscure. In this study, we sought to identify diffusible molecules produced during the HR that could induce cell death in naïve tissue. We found that 4-methylsulfinylbutyl isothiocyanate (sulforaphane) is released by Arabidopsis thaliana leaf tissue undergoing HR, and that this compound induces cell death as well as prime defense in naïve tissue. Two different mutants impaired in the pathogen-induced accumulation of sulforaphane displayed attenuated PCD upon bacterial and oomycete effector recognition as well as decreased resistance to several isolates of the plant pathogen Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis. Treatment with sulforaphane provided protection against a virulent H. arabidopsidis isolate. Glucosinolate breakdown products are recognized as antifeeding compounds towards insects and recently also as intracellular signaling and bacteriostatic molecules in Arabidopsis. The data presented herein indicate that these compounds also trigger local defense responses in Arabidopsis tissue.
Looking Back to the 1980s	Reflections on my running career starting in the early 1980s including links to extracts from my running log and race photos.
Looking Back, Looking Ahead: Priorities for a Strategy Now	Jennifer Bray, Teresa Atkinson and Simon Kitchen report on a major survey that sought to establish whether the objectives of the National Dementia Strategy and National Dementia  Declaration have been achieved – with a view to informing priorities for a future strategy.
Delivering the Future: Evaluation of a Multidisciplinary Clinical Leadership Programme in NHS Scotland.	The Delivering the Future (DtF) leadership programme was established in 2005 to strengthen senior clinical leadership capacity and capability across NHS Scotland. This paper reports on an evaluation of the programme to determine the extent to which the programme outcomes had been achieved. Sixty-seven (57%) programme participants responded to a questionnaire survey about their experience, and semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants (n=8) and senior leaders (n=7) at NHS Board level.   The programme was highly regarded by participants and strategic level leads. The majority of DtF participants had been promoted or taken on expanded roles since completing the programme, taking on greater leadership responsibility. The programme was seen to be a significant influence on accelerating the progression of individuals to these roles, and in developing skills to perform at a senior leadership level. The significant investment in the programme was thought to be worthwhile in terms of wider benefits, albeit with a need to make better collective use of the alumni at a national level.
The Image of Community Nursing: Implications for Future Student Recruitment	Young people’s perceptions of nursing and, in particular, community nursing, do not reflect the realities of the profession. Community nursing needs to promote a realistic and positive image to young people who may consider nursing as a future career pathway. Strategies to increase awareness and understanding of community nursing roles are urgently required to halt the dissonance between the political drivers influencing changes in community care services, the advancing complexities of nursing roles, and the stereotypical imagery of nursing that continues to influence public thinking and interpretation of roles. The article draws on research that investigated the views of 40 young people from four schools in the West Midlands regarding nursing as a profession.
Application of Redundancy Analysis for Aerobiological Data	An aerobiological survey was conducted through five consecutive years (2006–2010) at Worcester (England).The concentration of 20 allergenic fungal spore types was measured using a 7-day volumetric spore trap. The relationship between investigated fungal spore genera and selected meteorological parameters (maximum, minimum, mean and dew point temperatures, rainfall, relative humidity, air pressure,wind direction) was examined using an ordination method(redundancy analysis) to determine which environmental factors favoured their most abundance in the air and whether it would be possible to detect similarities between different genera in their distribution pattern. Redundancy analysis provided additional information about the biology of the studied fungi through the results of the Spearman’s rank correlation. Application of the variance inflation factor in canonical correspondence analysis indicated which explanatory variables were auto-correlated and needed to be excluded from further analyses. Obtained information will be consequently implemented in the selection of factors that will be a foundation for forecasting models for allergenic fungal spores in the future.
Frequency and Abundance of Pollen Taxa in Crime Case Samples from the United Kingdom	The frequency and abundance of pollen taxa in samples from crime cases in which forensic palynology had been employed,  was investigated by collating pre-existing data. Fifteen cases from England and Northern Ireland that represented a range of habitats and exhibit types were selected and a total of 199 samples were included in the analysis. Control samples were considered separately to those from exhibits. The latter contained a wider range of taxa and were more likely to contain pollen from planted ornamentals such as Cedrus, Ligustrum, Juglans and Platanus. Pollen of the Poaceae family occurred in 100% of samples and in the greatest mean abundance (25.65%) and the wind-pollinated taxa of Pinus, Betula, Quercus, Alnus, Fraxinus, Corylus and Urticaceae also occurred with very high frequency (> 80%). Most taxa had a mean abundance of < 6% but several were higher. Maximum abundance was also studied, varying greatly from the mean in some taxa, notably Castanea sativa, Plantago lanceolata-type, Pteridium aquilinum and Quercus. Not all taxa that occurred frequently were wind-pollinated: some members of the insect-pollinated families of the Apiaceae, Asteraceae, Brassicaceae, Ericaceae and Rosaceae, as well as Hedera helix and Sambucus, were quite frequently found, sometimes in relatively high maximum abundance. The results demonstrate that pollen from certain plants repeatedly occur in both control and exhibit samples. This information can assist with the evaluation of pollen profiles in crime cases.
Poppies, Tommies and Remembrance	The centenary of WWI has produced a plethora of activities and events, building upon the cultural obsession with remembrance that emerged in Britain in the last 30 years and in which the media plays a significant role. WWI frames contemporary practices of remembrance, but politicians, organisations and individuals contest the meanings of Remembrance Sunday and the Poppy. Remembrance, narratives, myths and memories of WWI are tied up with constructions of nationhood and recently there has been a blurring in the public imagination between contemporary conflicts and WWI. Broadcast media's focus on private lives and personal stories have led the Tommy to emerge as a new working class hero, a victim as well as a and family member and enabled those in the armed forces to have an increasingly central place in British cultural life. Questions remain about how this will shape Britain's military involvement in the current volatile global situation.
Identification of New Resistance Sources From Diploid Wild Strawberry Against Powdery Mildew Pathogen	Powdery mildew pathogen causes diseases in berries and resistance breeding is hampered by the lack of sufficient sources.  While control of fungal pathogens relies on chemical fungicides. In either case, a reliable source of resistance for breeding  purposes is imperative for efficient protection of the crop plants. A powdery mildew isolate designated GOU1 has been  identified as Podosphaera aphanis var. aphanis using light microscopy and sequencing the ITS region. Pathogenicity tests  on 3 diploid wild strawberry (Fragaria vesca L.) ecotypes with GOU1 revealed 3 distinctive interaction phenotypes;  enhanced susceptible (ecotype 1), intermediate susceptible (ecotype 2) and resistant (ecotype 3). In vitro staining methods  with diaminobenzidine and trypan blue showed massive mycelial web and conidiophore production on the susceptible  ecotype, but there was no mycelia and conidiophore production on the resistant ecotype 3. In the ecotype 3 conidiospore  penetration was associated with accumulation of hydrogen peroxide production on the host cells. These findings suggest that  these ecotypes could be explored as resistant gene sources to powdery mildew fungus.
Development of Molecular Markers Tightly Linked to Pvr4  Gene in Pepper Using Next-Generation Sequencing	It is imperative to identify highly polymorphic and tightly linked markers of a known trait for molecular marker-assisted selection. Potyvirus resistance 4 (Pvr4) locus in pepper confers resistance to three pathotypes of potato virus Y and to pepper mottle virus. We describe the use of next-generation sequencing technology to generate molecular markers tightly linked to Pvr4. Initially, comparative genomics was carried out, and a syntenic region of tomato on  chromosome ten was used to generate PCR-based markers and map Pvr4. Subsequently, the genomic sequence of pepper was used, and more than 5000 single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified within the interval. In addition, we identified nucleotide binding site–leucine-rich repeat-type disease resistance genes within the interval. Several of these SNVs were converted to molecular markers desirable  for large-scale molecular breeding programmes.
Gambling Problems in Bipolar Disorder in the UK: Prevalence and Distribution.	BackgroundNorth American studies show bipolar disorder is associated with elevated rates of problem gambling; however, little is known about rates in the different presentations of bipolar illness.AimsTo determine the prevalence and distribution of problem gambling in people with bipolar disorder in the UK.MethodThe Problem Gambling Severity Index was used to measure gambling problems in 635 participants with bipolar disorder.ResultsModerate to severe gambling problems were four times higher in people with bipolar disorder than in the general population, and were associated with type 2 disorder (OR = 1.74, P = 0.036), history of suicidal ideation or attempt (OR = 3.44, P = 0.02) and rapid cycling (OR = 2.63, P = 0.008).ConclusionsApproximately 1 in 10 patients with bipolar disorder may be at moderate to severe risk of problem gambling, possibly associated with suicidal behaviour and a rapid cycling course. Elevated rates of gambling problems in type 2 disorder highlight the probable significance of modest but unstable mood disturbance in the development and maintenance of such problems.
The Effectiveness of Workplace Coaching: A Meta-analysis of Learning and Performance Outcomes from Coaching.	This study presents a meta-analysis synthesizing the existing research on the effectiveness of workplace coaching. We exclusively explore workplace coaching provided by internal or external coaches and therefore exclude cases of manager-subordinate and peer coaching. We propose a framework of potential outcomes from coaching in organizations, which we examine meta-analytically (k = 17). Our analyses indicated that coaching had positive effects on organizational outcomes overall ( = 0.36), and on specific forms of outcome criteria (skill-based  = 0.28, affective  = 0.51; individual-level results  = 1.24). We also examined moderation by a number of coaching practice factors (use of multi-source feedback; type of coach; coaching format; longevity of coaching). Our analyses of practice moderators indicated a significant moderation of effect size for type of coach (with effects being stronger for internal coaches compared to external coaches) and use of multi-source feedback (with the use of multi-source feedback resulting in smaller positive effects). We found no moderation of effect size by coaching format (comparing face-to-face, with blended face-to face and e-coaching) or duration of coaching (number of sessions or longevity of intervention). The effect sizes give support to the potential utility of coaching in organizations. Implications for coaching research and practice are discussed.
Dis)located Olympic Patriots: Sporting Connections, Administrative Communications and Imperial Ether in Interwar New Zealand	During the interwar period (1919-1939) protagonists of the early New Zealand Olympic Committee [NZOC] worked to renegotiate and improve the country’s international sporting participation and involvement in the International Olympic Committee [IOC]. To this end, NZOC effectively used its locally based administrators and well-placed expatriates in Britain to variously assert the organisation’s nascent autonomy, independence and political power, progress Antipodean athlete’s causes, and, counter any potential doubt about the nation’s peripheral position in imperial sporting dialogues. Adding to the corpus of scholarship on New Zealand’s ties and tribulations with imperial Britain (in and beyond sport) (e.g. Beilharz and Cox 2007; Belich 2001, 2007; Coombes 2006; MacLean 2010; Phillips 1984, 1987; Ryan 2004, 2005, 2007), in this paper I examine how the political actions and strategic location of three key NZOC agents (specifically, administrator Harry Amos and expatriates Arthur Porritt and Jack Lovelock) worked in their own particular ways to assert the position of the organisation within the global Olympic fraternity. I argue that the efforts of Amos, Porritt and Lovelock also concomitantly served to remind Commonwealth sporting colleagues (namely Britain and Australia) that New Zealand could not be characterised as, or relegated to being, a  distal, subdued, or subservient colonial sporting partner. Subsequently I contend that NZOC’s development during the interwar period, and particularly the utility of expatriate agents, can be contextualised against historiographical shifts that encourage us to rethink, reimagine, and rework narratives of empire, colonisation, national identity, commonwealth and belonging.
Law and Ethics : a Midwifery Dilemma	Health care professionals are required by health care regulators to rationally and analytically resolve ethical dilemmas involving the people they encounter, putting the interests of those people first, respecting their decisions and upholding their rights. This can be a challenging task as many situations are complex and require professionals to provide care in an objective and compassionate manner regardless of their own views. Midwives and allied health professionals are directed by the Nursing and Midwifery Council's The Code: professional standards of practice and behaviour for nurses and midwives (NMC 2015) and as always, the best interests of the person they are caring for are paramount.
Other Customer Age: Exploring Customer Age-difference Related CCI	Purpose – This study aims to explore the relevance of customer age-differences (CAD) in the context of customer-to-customer interaction (CCI) within various service domains. It provides a thematic framework for understanding customer age-difference related CCI and critically identifies new directions for research into CAD-related CCI.    Design/methodology/approach – Using a narrative literature review approach, different perspectives in the literature on age-differences and CCI are analysed towards highlighting and emphasising valuable new themes.    Findings – Three coherent domains: the desire for social contact; fellow customer behaviour; and social identity issues are identified to interconnect a fragmented diversity of literature. Many themes for future research directions in the study of CAD-related CCI are identified.       Research limitations – Whilst a wide selection of literature sources is critically reviewed the fragmented nature of the literature on age-differences and CCI prevents the review covering all publications.    Practical implications – The paper provides service marketing managers and scholars with strategic CCI insights into better serving a diverse age-range of customers. These insights will undoubtedly stimulate timely investigation of new avenues to enhance service customer compatibility and satisfaction in increasingly age-diverse societies.    Originality/value – This paper provides the first overview of a wide range of strategic considerations aimed at explaining the impact of customer age-differences on CCI in service environments. Essentially, the paper elaborates opportunities and challenges in CAD-related CCI as critical themes for further investigations.
Diagnostic Communication in the Memory Clinic: a Conversation Analytic Perspective	Objectives: Whether and how patients should be told their dementia diagnosis, has been an area of much debate. While there is now recognition that early diagnosis is important for dementia care little research has looked at how dementia-related diagnostic information is actually verbally communicated. The limited previous research suggests that the absence of explicit terminology (e.g., use of the term Alzheimer's) is problematic. This paper interrogates this assumption through a conversation analysis of British naturalistic memory clinic interaction.    Method: This paper is based on video-recordings of communication within a UK memory clinic. Appointments with 29 patients and accompanying persons were recorded, and the corpus was repeatedly listened to, in conjunction with the transcripts in order to identify the segments of talk where there was an action hearable as diagnostic delivery, that is where the clinician is evaluating the patient's condition.    Results: Using a conversation analytic approach this analysis suggests that diagnostic communication, which is sensitive and responsive to the patient and their carers, is not predicated on the presence or absence of particular lexical choices. There is inherent complexity regarding dementia diagnosis, especially in the ‘early stages’, which is produced through and reflected in diagnostic talk in clinical encounters.    Conclusion: In the context of continuity of dementia care, diagnostic information is communicated in a way that conforms to intersubjective norms of minimizing catastrophic reactions in medical communication, and is sensitive to problems associated with ‘insight’ in terms of delivery and receipt or non-receipt of diagnosis.
Adaptive Self-regulation in Cycle Time Trials: Goal Pursuit, Goal Disengagement and the Affective Experience	Self-regulation research analyses behaviour and emotion through goal progress (Carver and Scheier 2013). Goal disengagement is advocated as an adaptive self-regulatory strategy for unattainable goals to reduce distress (Wrosch et al. 2003a; 2003b). In an attempt to further understand ongoing goal pursuit and emotions on endurance athletes, this paper applies adaptive self-regulation theory to interpret and explain the experiences of three cyclists in case studies which display variations in success and failure. Following criterion sampling methods we analysed positive and negative affect, goal expectancy and power output from three male participants (triathletes or cyclists; age range 26-50 yrs) who either successfully achieved their goal (Participant 1), were unsuccessful yet recalculated their goal (Participant 2) or failed to achieve their goal (Participant 3) in a 20 km laboratory cycle time trial. Post trial qualitative data provided explanations regarding pacing, perceptions of achievement and feeling states (self-chosen adjectives). Positive affect tracked goal expectancy with increases in positive affect when power output exceeded previous trial averages and goal expectations were high evidencing successful goal striving (Participant 1). Reductions in positive affect occurred where goal progress was below expectations. This reduction was dramatic in the unsuccessful trial (Participant 3). Low levels of positive affect and high levels of negative affect were reported from 12 – 20 km together with disappointment, unexpected feelings of a loss of control and fatigue, suggesting unsuccessful goal striving. Supporting goal disengagement theory, a relinquishment of goal commitment was evident for participant 2 who recalculated his goal. Despite being unsuccessful in achieving his original goal participant 2 reported positive feeling states and perceptions of control post trial indicating adaptive self-regulation strategies were effective in his specific situation. These findings emphasise the need to examine practical adaptive self-regulation strategies in sport and relationships between affect, decision making and goal striving.
Beyond Robotic Wastelands of Time: Abandoned Pedagogical Agents and New Pedalled Pedagogies	Chatbots, known as pedagogical agents in educational settings, have a long history of use,  beginning with Alan Turing’s work. Since then online chatbots have become embedded into the  fabric of technology. Yet understandings of these technologies are inchoate and often untheorised.  Integration of chatbots into educational settings over the past five years suggests an increase in  interest in the ways in which chatbots might be adopted and adapted for teaching and learning.  This article draws on historical literature and theories that to date have largely been ignored in  order to (re)contextualise two studies that used responsive evaluation to examine the use of  pedagogical agents in education. Findings suggest that emotional interactions with pedagogical  agents are intrinsic to a user’s sense of trust, and that truthfulness, personalisation and emotional  engagement are vital when using pedagogical agents to enhance online learning. Such findings need  to be considered in the light of ways in which notions of learning are being redefined in the  academy and the extent to which new literacies and new technologies are being pedalled as  pedagogies in ways that undermine what higher education is, is for, and what learning means.
Application of WRF-Chem to Forecasting PM10 Concentration Over Poland	The meteorological and chemical transport model WRF-Chem was  implemented to forecast PM10 concentrations over Poland. WRF-Chem  version 3.5 was configured with three one-way nested domains using the GFS  meteorological data and the TNO MACC II emissions. The 48 hour forecasts  were run for each day of the winter and summer period of 2014 and there is  only a small decrease in model performance for winter with respect to forecast  lead time. The model in general captures the variability in observed PM10  concentrations for most of the stations. However, for some locations and  specific episodes, the model performance is poor and the results cannot yet be  used by official authorities. We argue that a higher resolution sector-based  emission data will be helpful for this analysis in connection with a focus on  planetary boundary layer processes in WRF-Chem and their impact on the  initial distribution of emissions on both time and space.
Internal Migration, Sport and the Scottish Diaspora in England.	Sport has been argued to play an important role for members of diasporic groups of various origins and in various locations (Burdsey, 2006; Carrington, 2010; Darby and Hassan, 2008; Kaufman, 2005). However, little attention has been paid to the role sport plays for ‘internal migrants’ who migrate to contrasting locations within a nation-state, despite the potential for significant contrasts in the prevailing sporting cultures found in different regions of the same nation-state. This article therefore aims to make a contribution towards understanding this relationship by reflecting upon the role sport plays for members of the Scottish diaspora living in England, drawing upon interviews and personal reflections from a number of Scottish ‘internal migrants’ located within the United Kingdom. In particular, discussion attempts to draw attention to the central role sport plays for these individuals in order to maintain a cultural attachment with their Scottish birthplace, given the relative lack of other cultural practices or associations which could be used to achieve this goal. Comparisons are also drawn with studies  of the Scottish diaspora in more distant geographic contexts, as well as similar diasporic groups in the English context such as the Irish diaspora. These comparisons allow for a consideration of the impact of geographic proximity and cultural proximity on the relative importance of sport and other cultural practices for Scots living in England, identifying a number of important issues  for those studying the role played by sport in the maintenance of a cultural attachment with ‘home’ for various diasporic groups.
Validation of Electronic Health Record Phenotyping of Bipolar Disorder Cases and Controls	Objective: The study was designed to validate use of elec-tronic health records (EHRs) for diagnosing bipolar disorder and classifying control subjects.  Method: EHR data were obtained from a health care system of more than 4.6 million patients spanning more than 20 years. Experienced clinicians reviewed charts to identify text features and coded data consistent or inconsistent with a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Natural language processing was used to train a diagnostic algorithm with 95% specificity for classifying bipolar disorder. Filtered coded data were used to derive three additional classification rules for case subjects and one for control subjects. The positive predictive value (PPV) of EHR-based bipolar disorder and subphenotype di- agnoses was calculated against diagnoses from direct semi- structured interviews of 190 patients by trained clinicians blind to EHR diagnosis.  Results: The PPV of bipolar disorder defined by natural language processing was 0.85. Coded classification based on strict filtering achieved a value of 0.79, but classifications based on less stringent criteria performed less well. No EHR- classified control subject received a diagnosis of bipolar dis- order on the basis of direct interview (PPV=1.0). For most subphenotypes, values exceeded 0.80. The EHR-based clas- sifications were used to accrue 4,500 bipolar disorder cases and 5,000 controls for genetic analyses.  Conclusions: Semiautomated mining of EHRs can be used to ascertain bipolar disorder patients and control subjects with high specificity and predictive value compared with diagnostic interviews. EHRs provide a powerful resource for high-throughput phenotyping for genetic and clinical research.
Disability and Participation in the Professions:  Examples from Higher and Medical Education	Learners with disabilities remain under-represented in higher education and courses, such as medicine, that grant access to ‘the professions’. National and professional legislation, policy and guidance have changed over the last few decades in response to reforms in the way disability is viewed and valued by society.  Principles of equal rights and equality of opportunity inform the negotiation of widened participation in the professions. However, drawing on the example of medical education, it is possible to see that widening  articipation agendas may be insensitive to the needs of learners with disabilities. Analysing the development  of practice and policy from a participation perspective suggests that tokenism may have played a role in  deprioritising the voices of individuals with disabilities, rendering policy disconnected from the needs of marginalised groups. The concept of participatory parity may provide an opportunity to readdress  this misrepresentation.
Improvement in the Accuracy of Back Trajectories Using WRF to Identify Pollen Sources in Southern Iberian Peninsula	Airborne pollen transport at micro-, meso-gamma and meso-beta scales must be studied by atmospheric models, having special relevance in complex terrain. In these cases, the accuracy of these models is mainly determined by the spatial resolution of the underlying meteorological dataset. This work examines how meteorological datasets determine the results obtained from atmospheric transport models used to describe pollen transport in the atmosphere. We investigate the effect of the spatial resolution when computing backward trajectories with the HYSPLIT model. We have used meteorological datasets from the WRF model with 27, 9 and 3 km resolutions and from the GDAS files with 1 ° resolution. This work allows characterizing atmospheric transport of Olea pollen in a region with complex flows. The results show that the complex terrain affects the trajectories and this effect varies with the different meteorological datasets. Overall, the change from GDAS to WRF-ARW inputs improves the analyses with the HYSPLIT model, thereby increasing the understanding the pollen episode. The results indicate that a spatial resolution of at least 9 km is needed to simulate atmospheric flows that are considerable affected by the relief of the landscape. The results suggest that the appropriate meteorological files should be considered when atmospheric models are used to characterize the atmospheric transport of pollen on micro-, meso-gamma and meso-beta scales. Furthermore, at these scales, the results are believed to be generally applicable for related areas such as the description of atmospheric transport of radionuclides or in the definition of nuclear-radioactivity emergency preparedness.
Understanding Eating Disorders in Young People.	An outline of the causes of eating disorders in young people. Including anorexia nervosa. Anorexia nervosa has the highest morbidity of any mental illness. Children and young people require treatment from a systemic view. Practice nurses can be in a unique position in being able to identify early signs. Practice nurses have opportunities to make links with CAMHS and can have an ongoing role given the average length of illness is 5 years.
Comorbid Medical Illness in Bipolar Disorder	BACKGROUND:  Individuals with a mental health disorder appear to be at increased risk of medical illness.  AIMS:  To examine rates of medical illnesses in patients with bipolar disorder (n = 1720) and to examine the clinical course of the bipolar illness according to lifetime medical illness burden.  METHOD:  Participants recruited within the UK were asked about the lifetime occurrence of 20 medical illnesses, interviewed using the Schedules for Clinical Assessment in Neuropsychiatry (SCAN) and diagnosed according to DSM-IV criteria.  RESULTS:  We found significantly increased rates of several medical illnesses in our bipolar sample. A high medical illness burden was associated with a history of anxiety disorder, rapid cycling mood episodes, suicide attempts and mood episodes with a typically acute onset.  CONCLUSIONS:  Bipolar disorder is associated with high rates of medical illness. This comorbidity needs to be taken into account by services in order to improve outcomes for patients with bipolar disorder and also in research investigating the aetiology of affective disorder where shared biological pathways may play a role.
Pollen Monitoring: Minimum Requirements and Reproducibility of Analysis	Training, quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) play an important role in building competence in monitoring and research in aerobiology. The main goals of this paper were to: (a) formulate an updated Minimum Requirements Report for pollen monitoring; (b) carry out a pilot QC exercise of staff involved in pollen counting from various national networks in order to examine between analysts reproducibility and develop a methodology that can be used in future QC exercises. A questionnaire survey was sent to coordinators of participating pollen monitoring networks. In addition, a total of 45 technicians from 15 European countries participated in the pilot QC exercise. All technicians were instructed to analyse two slides containing the following pollen types: (a) Poaceae and Betula pollen grains in the north of Europe; (b) Poaceae and Olea pollen grains in the south of Europe. Minimum Recommendations were produced based on the results of the questionnaire survey, published literature, and the outcomes of a workshop. In the QC exercise, it was noticed that technicians who followed the Minimum Recommendations and examined at least 10 % of the slide tended to have better indicators of precision and accuracy than those technicians who did not follow the Minimum Recommendations. The proposed Minimum Recommendations will help to improve the quality of scientific work, particularly for those who are considering the setting up of new monitoring sites. The results of the pilot QC exercise will help to develop a methodology that can be used again in the future, thereby ensuring data quality.
"Just Going Through the Motions.…": A Qualitative Exploration of Athlete Perceptions of Social Loafing in Training and Competition Contexts - Implications for Team Sport Coaches	Semi-structured interviews were conducted with twenty team sport athletes representing a range of different sports with the aim of investigating their views relating to social loafing in training and competition. General themes investigated and subsequent content analysis highlighted  factors that promote or reduce the extent of social loafing. Determinants of self-loafing were grouped according to three distinct categories: Group processes; Task characteristics and Individual perceptions. Social loafing among others was perceived to be prevalent in both the training and competition scenarios with more examples of social loafing provided in the training situation. The signs of social loafing were grouped according to the  following themes: Cognitive & Emotional, Behavioural, Communication and Player Intuition. Consequences of social loafing were found to be detrimental to the effort and performance of both the individual and the team. Athletes were also able to differentiate between perceived social loafing and the perceived use of ‘strategic rest’ in team sports. Implications for the coaching process are far reaching with the need to develop an effective team culture and to provide training sessions that are interesting, engaging and relevant.
Atmospheric Concentrations of Alternaria, Cladosporium, Ganoderma and Didymella Spores Monitored in Cork (Ireland) and Worcester (England) During the Summer of 2010	This study represents the first international intercomparison of fungal spore observations since 1990, focusing on atmospheric concentrations of Alternaria, Cladosporium, Ganoderma and Didymella spores. The campaigns were performed at sites located in Cork (Ireland) and Worcester (England) during summer 2010. Observations were made using Hirst-type volumetric spore traps and corresponding optical identification at the genus level by microscope. The measurements at both sites (including meteorological parameters) were compared and contrasted. The relationships between the fungal spore concentrations with selected meteorological parameters were investigated using statistical methods and multivariate regression trees (MRT). The results showed high correlations between the two sites with respect to daily variations. Statistically significant higher spore concentrations for Alternaria, Cladosporium and Ganoderma were monitored at the Worcester site. This result was most likely due to the differences in precipitation and local fungal spore sources at the two sites. Alternaria and Cladosporium reached their maxima a month earlier in Cork than in Worcester, and Didymella with Ganoderma peaked simultaneously with similar diurnal trends found for all the investigated spore types. MRT analysis helped to determine threshold values of the meteorological parameters that exerted most influence on the presence of spores: they were found to vary at the two sites. Our results suggest that the aeromycological profile is quite uniform over the British Isles, but a description of bioaerosols with respect to overall load and daily concentration can be quite diverse although the geographical difference between sites is relatively small. These variations in the concentrations therefore need to be explored at the national level
The Value of Collaboration: Raising Confidence and Skills in Information Literacy With First Year Initial Teacher Education Students.	This paper will focus on the increasing staff-student-librarian collaboration, and integration of information literacy (IL) teaching, within a Primary Initial Teacher Education undergraduate course. These developments arose from an action research project which started during the academic year 2010-11. The aim of the research was to evaluate the impact of the IL teaching upon students’ confidence in their abilities to find, select and use information. Results of the first research cycle (2010-11) indicated that overall, the teaching had a positive and desirable impact upon students' confidence. However, staff and student feedback suggested that mutual expectations, and the consistency and timing of support, were important factors in the development of students' IL skills. During the analysis of our initial findings, we will focus our discussion around two identified themes which relate to these issues – role and collaboration – and share our experiences from the second and third cycles of the research, which led to a transformation of IL teaching for our students in 2013-14. This paper charts our four-year journey, sharing the ideas and opportunities realised through the project and through increased collaboration as a teaching team and with our students.  This paper is based on a presentation given at LILAC 2014.
Challenging the Moral Status of Blood Donation	The World Health Organisation encourages that blood donation becomes voluntary and unremunerated, a system already operated in the UK. Drawing on public documents and videos, this paper argues that blood donation is regarded and presented as altruistic and supererogatory. In advertisements, donation is presented as something undertaken for the benefit of others, a matter attracting considerable gratitude from recipients and the collecting organisation. It is argued that regarding blood donation as an act of supererogation is wrongheaded, and an alternative account of blood donation as moral obligation is presented. Two arguments are offered in support of this position. First, the principle of beneficence, understood in a broad consequentialist framework obliges donation where the benefit to the recipient is large and the cost to the donor relatively small. This argument can be applied, with differing levels of normativity, to various acts of donation. Second, the wrongness of free riding requires individuals to contribute to collective systems from which they benefit. Alone and in combination these arguments present moral reasons for donation, recognised in communication strategies elsewhere. Research is required to evaluate the potential effects on donation of a campaign which presents blood donation as moral obligation, but of wider importance is the recognition that other-regarding considerations in relation to our own as well as others’ health result in a range not only of choices but also of obligations.
Erythrocyte Phospholipid Molecular Species and Fatty Acids of Down Syndrome Children Compared with Non-affected Siblings	The majority of children with Down syndrome (DS) develop Alzheimer's disease (AD) at an early age. Although long-chain n-3 fatty acids (FA) are protective of neurodegeneration, little is known about the FA status in DS. In the present study, we aimed to investigate whether children with DS presented altered plasma and erythrocyte membrane phospholipids (PL) FA composition, when compared with their non-affected siblings. Venous blood samples were analysed for plasma and erythrocyte membrane FA composition by TLC followed by GC techniques. Lipid molecular species were determined by electrospray ionisation/tandem MS (ESI-MS/MS). FA analysis measured by standard GC showed an increased concentration of MUFA and a decreased concentration of plasmalogens in major PL fractions, but there were no differences in the concentrations of arachidonic acid or DHA. However, as identified by ESI-MS/MS, children with DS had increased levels of the following erythrocyte PL molecular species: 16 : 0–16 : 0, 16 : 0–18 : 1 and 16 : 0–18 : 2n-6, with reduced levels of 16 : 0–20 : 4n-6 species. Children with DS presented significantly higher levels of MUFA in both plasma and erythrocyte membrane, as well as higher levels of saturated and monounsaturated molecular species. Of interest was the almost double proportion of 16 : 0–18 : 2n-6 and nearly half the proportion of 16 : 0–20 : 4n-6 of choline phosphoacylglycerol species in children with DS compared with their non-affected siblings. These significant differences were only revealed by ESI-MS/MS and were not observed in the GC analysis. Further investigations are needed to explore molecular mechanisms and to test the association between the pathophysiology of DS and the risk of AD.
An Action Research Study Engaging in the Use of Storyboarding as Research-based Approach to Teaching to Identify Issues Faced when Working with People with Dementia from Minority Ethnic Communities	The common view that research informs teaching assumes a linear approach whereby teaching is considered an output of research. This paper reports the findings of an action research project that identified the issues and challenges faced by those working across health and social care when working with people with dementia from minority ethnic communities. It explored the research-teaching nexus by using an approach to teaching that was research-based as opposed to research-led.  A storyboarding technique was used which involved identifying and dissecting real life experiences for discussion. The realisation that each story was unique to the individual demonstrated the benefits and importance of education and training for applying a person-centred approach to dementia care.  This project also revealed the benefits of actively engaging course participants with research moving them from being recipients of research, to research- active. Such a process not only encouraged their intrinsic motivations but, also, critical thinking and reflective practice to support deep learning. Such findings demonstrate the benefits of linking teaching with research.
Distributional Learning Has Immediate and Long-Lasting Effects	Evidence of distributional learning, a statistical learning mechanism centered on relative frequency of exposure to different tokens, has mainly come from short-term learning and therefore does not ostensibly address the development of important learning processes. The present longitudinal study examines both short- and long-term effects of distributional learning of phonetic categories on non-native sound discrimination over a 12-month period. Two groups of listeners were exposed to a two-minute distribution of auditory stimuli in which the most frequently presented tokens either approximated or exaggerated the natural production of the speech sounds, whereas a control group listened to a piece of classical music for the same length of time. Discrimination by listeners in the two distribution groups improved immediately after the short exposure, replicating previous results. Crucially, this improvement was maintained after six and 12 months, demonstrating that distributional learning has long-lasting effects.
Judging Jack: Rethinking Historical Agency and the Sport Hero	One aspect of the dizzying (aesthetic, cultural, linguistic, visual, and post-modern)  ‘turns’ Sport history has taken in recent times has been the revision/deconstruction of sporting heroes and demystification of historical narratives. This, in turn, has attended to larger historical concerns about the centrality of agents and agency in narrative making.  Encouraged by these directions, this paper reconsiders the primacy afforded agents and their agency within national Olympic history creation. I examine revered 1930s track athlete Jack Lovelock who features predominantly within New Zealand’s Olympic history.  The paper aims to prompt contemplation about sport heroes. In particular, I argue sport historians should continue to decentre sport figures and bring alternate meanings, interpretations, and renderings of agents to the fore.
Novel `Crowdsourcing` Methods Will Have Global Impact.	The methods used by organisations to forecast the future have changed very little over the last sixty years whilst the speed of change and the level of volatility in the external environment has increased inexorably to hitherto unseen proportions. However, one of the causes of this volatility, Internet technology, may be responsible for providing a solution to the problems of forecasting in highly complex and fast moving macro and micro environments. Crowdsourcing has recently emerged as a credible forecasting technique where information is obtained by enlisting the services of a wide range of different people via the Internet and using this expertise to make future predictions relating to macroeconomic and geopolitical events.
Global Spread of Digital Healthcare Will Be Gradual.	The healthcare sector, until recently, has been much slower than other industries to introduce digital technology. Unlike shopping and banking, medicine is still largely conducted in hospitals and doctors surgeries with unquestioning patients seeking treatment and advice. However, due to three recent developments this trend may be about to change. The falling costs of sensors that can monitor bodily signals, the widespread use of smartphones and `tablets` which act as communication hubs and the development of big data analytics, are set to transform how people interact with themselves and the health system in general. The development of a wide range of health apps (100,000 are now available for smartphones) and wearable devices are also likely to accelerate this trend in the future.
Sochi 2014 Winter Olympics and the Controversy of the Russian Propaganda Laws: is the IOC Buckling Under the Pressure of its own Incoherence in Thought?	The Sochi Winter Olympics were a triumph in the eyes of Russia and the International Olympic Committee (IOC). Yet, a controversy around the introduction of anti-propaganda laws in Russia that had been criticised for being discriminatory marred the efforts of the IOC to fulfil its self proclaimed aspiration of ‘encouraging the harmonious development of man’. This article discusses the controversy utilising a legally pluralist approach to sports governance, and providing a critical reading of the practices of neoliberal globalisation that marked the issue of sexuality at the Sochi games. The paper argues that the legal influence of the IOC on domestic and international legal norms is contradictory and inconsistent. This, when considered alongside the aspirations of the IOC is significantly problematic and demonstrates the importance of investigating the underlying power structures of this influential international governing body.
Viewpoint 66: What is the Housing with Care ‘Offer’ and who is it for?	Published to coincide with the International Day of Older Persons, this viewpoint explores some of the findings from Adult Social Services Environments and Settings(ASSET), a research project that was funded by the NIHR School for Social Care Research from February 2012 to April 2014. The project explored how adult social care services are commissioned and delivered in extra care housing and retirement villages. It is a timely paper, coming hot off   the heels of the recent Commission on Residential Care, chaired by former Care Services Minister, Paul Burstow MP. This recommended greater clarification on what constitutes housing with care.
A Study of the Use of Social Media Marketing in the Football Industry.	Football clubs across the globe are realising that the use of social media is the future in terms of improving and expanding their business, whether this be for marketing purposes or as a medium for directly communicating with their fans. Although this study found that the majority of European teams researched have a social network presence, there was a difference in how effectively social media was used between the various leagues. This study demonstrates that most football clubs have some social media presence, such as the number of Facebook likes, Twitter tweets and YouTube videos. However, the findings indicate that well-known world-wide clubs don’t always use this commercial potential as effectively as they might and that teams with lesser prominence sometimes use social media in a more effective way in order to market effectively to their fan base.

Victimization Among Female and Male Sexual Minority Status Groups: Evidence From the British Crime Survey 2007–2010	International surveys of victims show crime rates in England and Wales, including hate crimes, are among the highest in Europe. Nevertheless, sexual minority status is a less considered risk factor in general victimization research. This study used sexual minority status and sex to predict victimization across British Crime Surveys from 2007–2010. Logistic regression analyses showed sexual minority status groups were more likely than heterosexuals to be victimized from any and some specic crimes. However, bisexuals rather than lesbians or gay men were more consistently victimized, notably by sexual attacks and within the household. Implications for understanding victimization among these groups are discussed.

Chinese Internet Giants Disrupt Traditional Markets.	Three large Chinese Internet firms known as BAT (Baidu, Alibaba and Tencent) have now become the largest private sector companies in China by market capitalisation and revenues. These technolology conglomerates have become known in Asia as the new “tech kereitsus” because of their ability to disrupt a range of industries and markets including media, transport, retail and financial services. By adopting a marketplace model, which allows merchants to interact with customers and avoids any physical shipment of goods, these `pure Internet` firms are changing the economics of many traditional state-owned business sectors. This is a trend that has been triggered by the rapid diffusion of smartphone ownership, with 500 million Chinese citizens using mobile devices to transact business over the Internet.
Augmenting Live Performance Dance through Mobile Technology	We present a pilot study investigating the use of mobile technology to augment live performance dance. An augmented performance was created and viewed through an tablet device then analysed from a technical and audience standpoint. Low complexity augmentations were found to be very effective, however the device placed restrictions on higher complexity augmentations, the performance length and the stage/audience spatial arrangements. A low-number audience test indicated that augmentation of live performance was a credible concept, though there are some clear challenges to be overcome specifically around speed of technology and weight of device.
Intramuscular Injection Technique: an Evidence-based Approach	Intramuscular injections require a thorough and meticulous approach to patient assessment and injection technique. This article, the second in a series of two, reviews the evidence base to inform safer practice and to consider the evidence for nursing practice in this area. A framework for safe practice is included, identifying important points for safe technique, patient care and clinical decision making. It also highlights the ongoing debate in selection of intramuscular injection sites, predominately the ventrogluteal and dorsogluteal muscles.
“It’s a Huge Maze, the System, it’s a Terrible Maze”: Dementia Carers’ Constructions of Navigating Health and Social Care Services.	Dementia is a challenging, progressive set of conditions which present a large care burden to informal, familial carers. A complex array of health and social care services are needed to support people living with dementia. Drawing on the interlinked ‘Duties to Care’ and ‘Dementia Talking’ projects, in this article we focus on British carers’ talk about health and social care services. We explore data from a mixed-method questionnaire (n = 185), four focus groups and eleven interviews with informal carers of people living with dementia using thematic discourse analysis. Three themes are discussed: (1) services as a ‘maze’; (2) services as overly limited – ‘beyond our remit’; and (3) the battle and fighting discourse deployed by these carers. Our analysis highlights that carers find navigating systemic issues in dementia care time-consuming, unpredictable and often more difficult than the caring work they undertake.
Evidence-Based Practice in Physiotherapy: A Systematic Review of Barriers, Enablers and Interventions.	Background: Despite clear benefits of the Evidence-Based Practice (EBP) approach to ensuring quality and consistency of care, its uptake within physiotherapy has been inconsistent.    Objectives: Synthesise the findings of research into EBP barriers, facilitators and interventions in physiotherapy and identify methods of enhancing adoption and implementation.    Data sources: Literature concerning physiotherapists’ practice between 2000-2012 was systematically searched using: Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, American Psychological association databases, Medline, Journal Storage, and Science Direct. Reference lists were searched to identify additional studies.    Study selection: Thirty-two studies, focusing either on physiotherapists’ EBP knowledge, attitudes or implementation, or EBP interventions in physiotherapy were included.    Data extraction and synthesis: One author undertook all data extraction and a second author reviewed to ensure consistency and rigour. Synthesis was organised around the themes of EBP barriers/enablers, attitudes, knowledge/skills, use and interventions.    Results: Many physiotherapists hold positive attitudes towards EBP. However, this does not necessarily translate into consistent, high-quality EBP. Many barriers to EBP implementation are apparent, including: lack of time and skills, and misperceptions of EBP.    Limitations: Only studies published in the English language, in peer-reviewed journals were included, thereby introducing possible publication bias. Furthermore, narrative synthesis may be subject to greater confirmation bias.    Conclusion and implications: There is no “one-size fits all” approach to enhancing EBP implementation; assessing organisational culture prior to designing interventions is crucial. Although some interventions appear promising, further research is required to explore the most effective methods of supporting physiotherapists’ adoption of EBP.
A Review of the Training and Resources Available to Support the Excellence in the Teaching of Psychology in High Education in the United Kingdom.	This review considers the range of training and resources that are available to support excellence in the teaching of psychology in higher education in the UK. Various sources of support are reviewed, including both generic and specific mechanisms provided by either the Higher Education Academy (HEA) or the British Psychological Society (BPS). The training considered ranges from that provided for all new lecturers in the UK by their institutions, through to bespoke seminars and workshops delivered by the HEA and the BPS. Resources include written guidance, websites and sources of funding to support the development of teaching and learning. It is concluded that whilst there are currently some excellent resources available to support psychology teachers in higher education, recent changes to the HEA have created some uncertainty in the sector.
European Telecoms Will Not Become a Single Market.	The failure of the European telecoms sector to live up to its post-regulation era expectations in the 1990s has recently led to a number high profile meetings between politicians, regulators and the heads of the leading telecoms companies. Attempts are being made to find a solution to the poor financial performance of the European telecoms sector and the threat this is posing to European competiveness in the global economy. Despite full liberalisation of the European telecoms industry in 1998, the industry still remains highly fragmented along national lines. Unlike the USA and China, which have a single telecoms regulator and one authority that allocates mobile spectrum, Europe has 28 highly protective national regulators who are creating barriers to the establishment of a single European market in telecommunications. Attempts by the incumbent telecoms companies to move towards a Pan-European market model through consolidation (mergers and acquisitions) have also been hampered by EU anti-trust regulations.
Predicting Walnut (Juglans spp.) Crop Yield Using Meteorological and Airborne Pollen Data	Crop yield determines economy by influencing prices on the trade market,and so accurate forecasts of the yield are important for planning various aspects of agricultural production. The main aim of this study is to construct a model for predicting walnut yield in an important walnut production area (the region of Novi Sad in Northern Serbia). Relationships between the amount of walnuts produced annually (2000–2011) and a biotic (e.g. meteorological) and biotic (e.g. airborne pollen data) factors were examined using Pearson correlation analysis. Walnut yield data were then entered into linear regression models with variables that had the highest correlations. The models were constructed using 10 years of data, and tested using 2 years of data not included in constructing the model. This paper has shown that walnut yield is greatly dependent on weather conditions, particularly during fertilisation and seed growth, but the amount of available airborne pollen also plays an important role. The introduction of the seasonal pollen index, as a proxy for the amount of pollen available for fertilisation, improved the performance of models predicting walnut yield.
A Study of Iranian Nurses’ and Midwives’  Knowledge, Attitudes, and Implementation of Evidence-Based Practice: The Time for Change Has Arrived.	Background  Evidence-based practice (EBP) leads to enhanced quality of care, and the individual and professional development of nurses and midwives. Therefore, it is important for nurses and midwives as well as all other healthcare providers and stakeholders to inform clinical decision-making and implement EBP.    Aim  This study aimed to determine the EBP knowledge, attitudes, and practice of clinical nurses and midwives in Mashhad public hospitals in Iran.    Methods  The descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with a stratified cluster, random sample of 240 employed nurses and midwives (response rate of 96%) in Mashhad, who held a Bachelor of Science degree and had at least 1 year of clinical experience. Two valid and reliable questionnaires were used to collect demographic and EBP data. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 11.5 software and descriptive and inferential statistics calculated.    Results  Participants’ mean age was 31.0 (SD = 5.5) years and 80% (n = 194) were female. Most participants reported low knowledge or skills and practice of EBP, but moderate attitudes toward EBP. Significant differences between the mean scores on knowledge or skills, attitudes, and practice were identified by field of study. Nurses reported higher knowledge or skills and practice of EBP than midwives (p < .001). MSc nurses and midwives displayed greater knowledge or skills and practice of EBP, and more positive attitudes than BSc nurses (p < .001).    Linking Evidence to Action  Although clinical nurses and midwives apply EBP in clinical settings, it is necessary to develop their knowledge or skills and practice. The results of this study can be applied by educational planners, educational managers, and authorities in order to enhance the quality and consistency of EBP implementation. The results provide a base for future studies in this field.
John Paley's Challenge (JAN Forum)	John Paley's ‘Heidegger, lived experience and method’ (2013) challenges phenomenologists who rely on Heidegger for theoretical support and guidance to review, critically, their grounding assumptions. If Paley's critique ‘holds’, it could be that the argumentative coherence and, by implication, usefulness of a considerable number of supposedly Heideggerian informed studies collapse. Moreover, the manner in which Paley's challenge is met may tell us much – for good or ill – about the rigour and status of nursing scholarship. This aspect of Paley's challenge is underdeveloped in his paper and it is this aspect of his work that I discuss here.
Relating Differently to Intrusive Images: The Impact of Mindfulness Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) on Intrusive Images in Patients With Severe Health Anxiety (Hypochondriasis).	Recurrent distressing intrusive images are a common experience in hypochondriasis. The aim of the current study was to assess the impact of Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) for hypochondriasis on the occurrence and nature of distressing intrusive imagery in hypochondriasis. A semi-structured interview was used to assess intrusive imagery, and an adapted version of the Southampton Mindfulness Questionnaire (SMQ) was used to assess participants’ relationship with their intrusive images. A consecutive series of participants (N = 20) who were receiving MBCT for hypochondriasis as part of an ongoing research program were assessed prior to participating in an 8-week MBCT intervention, immediately following the intervention, and at three month follow-up. As compared to the baseline assessment, the frequency of intrusive images, the distress associated with them, and the intrusiveness of the images were all significantly reduced at the post-MBCT assessment. Participants’ adapted SMQ scores were significantly increased following the MBCT intervention, suggesting that participants’ relationship with their intrusive images had changed in that they had developed a more ‘mindful’ and compassionate response to the images when they did occur. Effect sizes from pre- to post-intervention were medium to large (Cohen’s d = 0.75 - 1.50). All treatment gains were maintained at 3 month follow-up. Results suggest that MBCT may be an effective intervention for addressing intrusive imagery in hypochondriasis.
Native and Non-Native Speech Perception	This review examines research on speech perception by both native and non-native listeners. The development of speech  perception in infancy is first considered and a theoretical model that accounts for this is introduced. A brief overview then follows of several research areas under the umbrella of non-native speech perception, namely cross-dialect, cross-language and second-language speech perception. It is shown that non-native and native speech perception is critically shaped by the specific ways in which speakers use acoustic cues in speech production.
Gut Microbiota, Probiotics and Diabetes	Diabetes is a condition of multifactorial origin, involving several molecular mechanisms related to the intestinal  microbiota for its development. In type 2 diabetes, receptor activation and recognition by microorganisms from  the intestinal lumen may trigger inflammatory responses, inducing the phosphorylation of serine residues in insulin  receptor substrate-1, reducing insulin sensitivity. In type 1 diabetes, the lowered expression of adhesion proteins  within the intestinal epithelium favours a greater immune response that may result in destruction of pancreatic  β cells by CD8+ T-lymphocytes, and increased expression of interleukin-17, related to autoimmunity. Research in  animal models and humans has hypothesized whether the administration of probiotics may improve the prognosis  of diabetes through modulation of gut microbiota. We have shown in this review that a large body of evidence  suggests probiotics reduce the inflammatory response and oxidative stress, as well as increase the expression of  adhesion proteins within the intestinal epithelium, reducing intestinal permeability. Such effects increase insulin sensitivity and reduce autoimmune response. However, further investigations are required to clarify whether the administration of probiotics can be efficiently used for the prevention and management of diabetes.
New Robotics Tech Will Transform Industries Globally	After a number of false dawns, the global robotics industry is currently seeing a second wave of growth building on the first wave that took place in the automotive sector 40 years ago. Key economic and technological drivers are behind the recent growth in industrial automation that is now moving from the factory floor into higher value service sectors and the home. The need for companies and countries to off-set higher wage costs and remain competitive in the global marketplace and the advent of new technologies have all been responsible for this new growth trend. Foxconn, the Taiwanese contract manufacturer, is currently replacing its labour-intensive workforce with an army of one million robots as China becomes less productive and competitive with competing economies.
The Work–study Nexus: the Challenges of Balancing Full-time  Business Degree Study with a Part-time Job	This study examined how full-time university students cope with part-time working during term time. A qualitative approach was used to examine how students simultaneously manage the two activities, and how part-time working affects  their academic study. Semi-structured interviews were used to obtain data from a sample of 30 undergraduate business students. The findings confirm that students merely satisfice many aspects of their lives, with time set aside for reading and assignment preparation being areas that are most likely to suffer in order to allow students to engage with part-time work. Possible options available to higher education institutions to adapt to, and remedy, the situation are explored in the conclusion
Promoting the 6Cs of Nursing in Patient Assessment	Recognising the deteriorating patient is an essential nursing skill, and structured frameworks should be in place to assist effective patient assessment. The aim of this article is to encourage nurses to consider how to promote the 6Cs of nursing within such assessment. The article provides an overview of the Patient Assessment and Clinical reasoning Tool designed to facilitate the development of clinical reasoning skills and effective communication with other healthcare professionals, therebyenhancing patientcentred  care.
US Tech Firms May Disrupt Asset Management Industry.	The recent expansion by the leading Internet firms into financial services has created fears among asset managers that the future of investment companies could be under threat if these major technology firms decide to offer fund management services. The failure of asset management companies to keep abreast of new technological developments has made them highly vulnerable to disruption. The data-rich Internet firms, with their wide networks of existing customers, have the capability to use their technology platforms to provide a cheaper and more convenient asset management service tailored to individual consumer needs. A number of technology firms have already begun to offer fund management services in both Europe and China with startling results.
Appreciative Inquiry – a Research Tool for Institutional Change	Appreciative Inquiry (AI) emanated from the PhD work of David Cooperrider at Case Western Reserve University in the 1980s. Founded upon social constructionist theories  (Berger & Luckmann,1966, Gergen, 2009), it is an approach to organizational change that eschews former Organization Development (OD) deficit models in favour of a positive  approach to change that builds a vision for the future based upon what already works well within an existing system. It also provides a framework for researching or evaluating different forms of professional practice, including learning, teaching and the student experience. Its self-empowering philosophy, effected through the ‘4-D’ process (Discover, Dream, Design and Destiny), is realized through the collaborative working of all stakeholders within an institution; through systematic participation in a jointly constructed vision of an organization’s future, they become an integral part of its success. At its core is the unconditional positive  question, which seeks out the best of ‘what is’ in order to prompt the collective imagination to envision ‘what might be’.    The use of AI within higher education in the UK is not yet well-developed and existing studies of the application of AI to this context have tended to focus principally on the areas of teaching and institutional change. It is suggested that through the publication of recent books such as ‘Appreciative Inquiry in Higher Education: A Transformative Force’ (Cockell, McArthur-Blair & Schiller, 2013), it will perhaps become more widely adopted in this context.
Relationship Between Obesity and the Risk of Clinically Significant Depression: Mendelian Randomisation Study	Background:  Obesity has been shown to be associated with depression and it has been suggested that higher body mass index (BMI) increases the risk of depression and other common mental disorders. However, the causal relationship remains unclear and Mendelian randomisation, a form of instrumental variable analysis, has recently been employed to attempt to resolve this issue.    Aims:  To investigate whether higher BMI increases the risk of major depression.    Method:  Two instrumental variable analyses were conducted to test the causal relationship between obesity and major depression in RADIANT, a large case-control study of major depression. We used a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in FTO and a genetic risk score (GRS) based on 32 SNPs with well-established associations with BMI.    Results:  Linear regression analysis, as expected, showed that individuals carrying more risk alleles of FTO or having higher score of GRS had a higher BMI. Probit regression suggested that higher BMI is associated with increased risk of major depression. However, our two instrumental variable analyses did not support a causal relationship between higher BMI and major depression (FTO genotype: coefficient –0.03, 95% CI –0.18 to 0.13, P = 0.73; GRS: coefficient –0.02, 95% CI –0.11 to 0.07, P = 0.62).    Conclusions:  Our instrumental variable analyses did not support a causal relationship between higher BMI and major depression. The positive associations of higher BMI with major depression in probit regression analyses might be explained by reverse causality and/or residual confounding.
Thermal Sensitivity To Warmth During Rest and Exercise: A Sex Comparison.	Purpose The study aimed to compare thermal sensation in response to a fixed warm stimulus across 31 body locations in resting and active males and females.     Methods Twelve males (20.6 ± 1.0 yrs, 78.1 ± 15.6 kg, 180 ± 8.9 cm, 34.4 ± 5.2 ml•kg-1•min-1) and 12 females (20.6 ± 1.4 yrs, 62.9 ± 5.5 kg, 167 ± 5.7 cm, 36.5 ± 6.6 ml•kg-1•min-1) rested in a thermoneutral (22.2 ± 2.2°C, 35.1 ± 5.8% RH) room whilst a thermal probe (25 cm2), set at 40°C was applied in a balanced order to 31 locations across the body. Participants reported their thermal sensation 10 seconds after initial application. Following this, participants began cycling at 50% 〖"V"  ̇"O" 〗_"2max"  for 20 minutes, which was then lowered to 30% 〖"V"  ̇"O" 〗_"2max"  and the sensitivity test repeated.     Results Females had significantly warmer magnitude sensations than males at all locations (4.7 ± 1.8 vs 3.6 ± 2.2, p<0.05, respectively). Regional differences in thermal sensation were evident but were more prominent for females. Thermal sensation was greatest at the head then the torso and declined towards the extremities. In comparison to rest, exercise caused a significant reduction in thermal sensation for males (∆thermal sensation; 0.86 ± 0.3, p<0.05) but only at select locations in females (0.31 ± 0.56, p>0.05).     Conclusion The data provides evidence that the thermal sensation response to warmth varies between genders and between body regions and reduces during exercise. These findings have important implications for clothing design and thermophysiological modelling
Research Report Appraisal: How Much Understanding is Enough?	When appraising research papers, how much understanding is enough? More specifically, in deciding whether research results can inform practice, do appraisers need to substantively understand how findings are derived or is it sufficient simply to grasp that suitable analytic techniques were chosen and used by researchers? The degree or depth of understanding that research appraisers need to attain before findings can legitimately/sensibly inform practice is underexplored. In this paper it is argued that, where knowledge/justified beliefs derived from research evidence prompt actions that materially affect patient care, appraisers have an epistemic duty to demand high (maximal) rather than low (minimal) levels of understanding regards finding derivation (i.e. appraisers have a duty to seek a superior epistemic situation). If this argument holds assumptions about appraiser competence/ability and the feasibility of current UK conceptions of evidence based practice are destabilized.
Affect-Based Effects of Simulation Games on Learning	Empirical evidence has demonstrated the benefits of using simulation games in enhancing learning especially in terms of cognitive gains. This is to be expected as the dynamism and non-linearity of simulation games are more cognitively demanding. However, the other effects of simulation games, specifically in terms of learners’ emotions, have not been given much attention and are under-investigated. This study aims to demonstrate that simulation games stimulate positive emotions from learners that help to enhance learning. The study finds that the affect-based constructs of interest, engagement and appreciation are positively correlated to learning. A stepwise multiple regression analysis shows that a model involving interest and engagement are significantly associated with learning. The emotions of learners should be considered in the development of curriculum, and the delivery of learning and teaching as positive emotions enhances learning.
Genetic Relationships Between Suicide Attempts, Suicidal Ideation and Major Psychiatric Disorders: a Genome-wide Association and Polygenic Scoring Study	Epidemiological studies have recognized a genetic diathesis for suicidal behavior, which is independent of other psychiatric disorders. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) on suicide attempt (SA) and ideation have failed to identify specific genetic variants. Here, we conduct further GWAS and for the first time, use polygenic score analysis in cohorts of patients with mood disorders, to test for common genetic variants for mood disorders and suicide phenotypes. Genome-wide studies for SA were conducted in the RADIANT and GSK-Munich recurrent depression samples and London Bipolar Affective Disorder Case-Control Study (BACCs) then meta-analysis was performed. A GWAS on suicidal ideation during antidepressant treatment had previously been conducted in the Genome Based Therapeutic Drugs for Depression (GENDEP) study. We derived polygenic scores from each sample and tested their ability to predict SA in the mood disorder cohorts or ideation status in the GENDEP study. Polygenic scores for major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder and schizophrenia from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were used to investigate pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and suicide phenotypes. No significant evidence for association was detected at any SNP in GWAS or meta-analysis. Polygenic scores for major depressive disorder significantly predicted suicidal ideation in the GENDEP pharmacogenetics study and also predicted SA in a combined validation dataset. Polygenic scores for SA showed no predictive ability for suicidal ideation. Polygenic score analysis suggests pleiotropy between psychiatric disorders and suicidal ideation whereas the tendency to act on such thoughts may have a partially independent genetic diathesis.
‘The Living Death of Alzheimer’s’ Versus ‘Take a Walk to Keep Dementia at Bay’: Representations of Dementia in Print Media and Carer Discourse	Understanding dementia is a pressing social challenge. This paper draws on the ‘Dementia talking: care conversation and communication’ project which aims to understand how talk about, and to, people living with dementia is constructed. In this paper I draw on the construction of dementia manifest in two data-sets - a corpus of 350 recent UK national newspaper articles and qualitative data derived from in-depth interviews with informal carers. These data were analysed using a thematic discursive approach. A ‘panic-blame’ framework was evident in much of the print media coverage. Dementia was represented in catastrophic terms as a ‘tsunami’ and ‘worse than death’, juxtaposed with coverage of individualistic behavioural change  and lifestyle recommendations to ‘stave off’ the condition. Contrary to this media discourse, in carers’ talk there was scant use of hyperbolic metaphor or reference to individual responsibility for dementia, and any corresponding blame and accountability. I argue that the presence of individualistic dementia ‘preventative’ behaviours in media discourse is problematic, especially in comparison to other more ‘controllable’ and treatable chronic conditions. Engagement with, and critique of, the nascent ‘panic-blame’ cultural context may be fruitful in enhancing positive social change for people diagnosed with dementia and their carers.
How do International Trainee Teachers and Mentors Respond to Cross-cultural Mentoring Relationships?	Forty-one percent of the trainee teachers who trained to teach modern foreign languages (MFL) at the University of Worcester between September 2008 and June 2011 were international trainee teachers who spoke English as an additional language. International trainee teachers and home trainee teachers do not usually share the same mother tongue or the same culture. A small-scale research project was conducted using both qualitative and quantitative methods to consider international trainee teacher and mentor attitudes to cross-cultural mentoring relationships. The study found that it was critically important to facilitate communication between mentor and trainee teachers in order to support the development of cross-cultural mentoring relationships, to help avoid misunderstandings and to enable trainee teachers to meet their potential.
Depression in First Episode Psychosis: the Role of Subordination and Shame	Depression in early psychosis is linked to poor outcome, relapse and risk of suicide, yet remains poorly understood. This article aims to examine the development of depression in acute and post psychotic phases of first episode psychosis (FEP), and its relationship to persecutors, voices, insight, and recovery. Data were gathered on 92 patients with acute FEP on depression course, severity and experience of positive symptoms, insight and appraisals of illness using validated semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Measures were repeated at 12 months. Malevolent voices, use of safety behaviours and subordination to persecutors were associated with depression and suicidal behaviour in acute FEP. Loss, Shame, low level continuing positive symptoms and longer duration of untreated psychosis were associated with post psychotic depression. Negative appraisals remained stable despite recovery in other symptom domains. Thus, depression and risk in early psychosis may be propagated by the personal significance and content of positive symptoms experienced. When in recovery, low level symptoms, longer period of illness and negative appraisals are significant factors.
The Evidence-Based Practice Profiles of Academic and Clinical Staff Involved in Pre-registration Nursing Students' Education: A Cross Sectional Survey of US and UK Staff	Background  Competency in evidence-based practice (EBP) is a requirement for graduate nurses. Despite a growing body of research exploring the EBP profiles of students, little research has explored the EBP profiles of nurse educators.    Objectives  To explore: the differences/similarities in the EBP profiles of US and UK clinical and academic faculty; the barriers nurse educators experience when teaching EBP; the impact of postgraduate education on EBP profile and; what nurse educators perceive “success” in implementing and teaching EBP to be.    Design  A cross-sectional online survey design was employed.    Settings  Two Universities delivering undergraduate nursing education in the US and UK, in partnership with large hospital systems, small community hospitals, community settings, and independent sector health organisations.    Participants  Eighty-one nurse educators working in academic and clinical contexts in the US and UK (US academic = 12, US clinical = 17, UK academic = 9, UK clinical = 43) were recruited opportunistically.    Methods  Participants were emailed a weblink to an online survey, comprising demographic questions, the Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire and open-ended questions about EBP barriers, facilitators and successes.    Results  Quantitative results indicated that academic faculty scored significantly higher on knowledge and skills of EBP, than clinical faculty, but revealed no other significant differences on EBP use or attitudes, or between US and UK professionals. Participants with postgraduate training scored significantly higher on EBP knowledge/skills, but not EBP attitudes or use. Qualitative findings identified key themes relating to EBP barriers and facilitators, including: Evidence-, organisational-, and teaching-related issues. Perceptions of successes in EBP were also described.    Conclusions  Nurse educators working in the UK and US face similar EBP barriers to teaching and implementation, but view it positively and use it frequently. Clinical staff may require extra support to maintain their EBP knowledge and skills in comparison to staff working in academic contexts.
Internet Gives Small Companies A New Global Leg Up.	Despite the launch of the enterprise culture in the UK and Western Europe during the 1980s there has been a failure to grow small businesses into larger firms. Key reasons for this have been the lack of access to funding, cash flow issues and general resource constraints. The recent downturn in the UK and Eurozone economies has served to compound these difficulties thereby threatening the very survival and success of start-up ventures and established small businesses, as well as stymieing potential future growth.   This article explores the extent to which start-up ventures and established small firms are able to overcome resource-constraints and run asset-light business models using the Internet as a digital ecosystem. The digital ecosystem of a small business is defined as the combination of all the relevant digital technologies that the firm interacts with and the technology platform (the Internet) that supports this.
Poetry With People With Dementia: An Evaluation of a  Two Year Project Engaging in Poetry Activities With Older  People in Residential and Nursing Homes.	This paper is a summary of an evaluation of the first two  years of a three year poetry project for older people with  dementia. The project was set up with a poet in residence  who mentored six poets to deliver poetry activities to older  people and those with dementia in residential and care  homes in Herefordshire.  The project was developed and run by the Courtyards  Hereford. The evaluation was undertake through the  use of questionnaires that were given to staff and carers  undertaking training workshops and the poets, staff and  carers in the homes who facilitated the activities and finally  by the residents who took part in the project.  The main findings were that participants that responded  to the questionnaire for staff and carers it had increased  confidence and assisted them in gaining more knowledge  about the residents, whilst for residents it had a number  of positive effects including enhanced communication,  increased self-esteem and enhanced self-worth whilst  making them feel less isolated.
Technology Undermines Cable Television Globally.	The Internet and digitisation has significantly changed the way in which media content has been consumed over recent years. There is now evidence of further industry disruption occurring as a new group of Internet-based firms focus their attention on the connected home as the next battle ground in their fight for control of the living room. Traditional television and the $2.2 trillion entertainment industry is about to be massively disrupted as companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple and Netflix develop new platforms for the delivery of content. High levels of dissatisfaction with current cable TV providers has resulted in millions of Americans `cutting the cord` and accessing content via new distribution channels and devices.
Geographic and Temporal Variations in Pollen Exposure Across Europe	Abstract    Background    The EC-funded EuroPrevall project examined the prevalence of food allergy across Europe. A well-established factor in the occurrence of food allergy is primary sensitization to pollen.    Objective    To analyse geographic and temporal variations in pollen exposure, allowing the investigation of how these variations influence the prevalence and incidence of food allergies across Europe.    Methods    Airborne pollen data for two decades (1990–2009) were obtained from 13 monitoring sites located as close as possible to the EuroPrevall survey centres. Start dates, intensity and duration of Betulaceae, Oleaceae, Poaceae and Asteraceae pollen seasons were examined. Mean, slope of the regression, probability level (P) and dominant taxa (%) were calculated. Trends were considered significant at P < 0.05.    Results    On a European scale, Betulaceae, in particular Betula, is the most dominant pollen exposure, two folds higher than to Poaceae, and greater than five folds higher than to Oleaceae and Asteraceae. Only in Reykjavik, Madrid and Derby was Poaceae the dominant pollen, as was Oleaceae in Thessaloniki. Weed pollen (Asteraceae) was never dominant, exposure accounted for >10% of total pollen exposure only in Siauliai (Artemisia) and Legnano (Ambrosia). Consistent trends towards changing intensity or duration of exposure were not observed, possibly with the exception of (not significant) decreased exposure to Artemisia and increased exposure to Ambrosia.    Conclusions    This is the first comprehensive study quantifying exposure to the major allergenic pollen families Betulaceae, Oleaceae, Poaceae and Asteraceae across Europe. These data can now be used for studies into patterns of sensitization and allergy to pollen and foods.
Variations in Quercus sp. Pollen Seasons (1996--2011) in Poznań, Poland, in Relation to Meteorological Parameters	The aim of this study is to supply detailed information about oak (Quercus sp.) pollen seasons in Pozna\', Poland, based on a 16-year aerobiological data series (1996--2011). The pollen data were collected using a volumetric spore trap of the Hirst design located in Pozna\' city center. The limits of the pollen seasons were calculated using the 95Â % method. The influence of meteorological parameters on temporal variations in airborne pollen was examined using correlation analysis. Start and end dates of oak pollen seasons in Pozna\' varied markedly from year-to-year (14 and 17Â days, respectively). Most of the pollen grains (around 75Â % of the seasonal pollen index) were recorded within the first 2Â weeks of the pollen season. The tenfold variation was observed between the least and the most intensive pollen seasons. These fluctuations were significantly related to the variation in the sum of rain during the period second fortnight of March to first fortnight of April the year before pollination (rÂ =Â 0.799; pÂ <Â 0.001). During the analyzing period, a significant advance in oak pollen season start dates was observed (â��0.55Â day/year; pÂ =Â 0.021), which was linked with an increase in the mean temperature during the second half of March and first half of April (+0.2Â °C; pÂ =Â 0.014). Daily average oak pollen counts correlated positively with mean and maximum daily temperatures, and negatively with daily rainfall and daily mean relative humidity.

The Early-Career Development of Science Teachers From Initial Training Onwards: the Advantages of a Multifaceted Five-Year Programme	If a programme were to be devised for the early-career development of science teachers, what might such a programme look like? This was the focus of a meeting of science educators interested in developing such a structure, from the start of initial teacher training onwards. The contributions, modified and written up here, include a suggested ‘five-year programme’ that has  ideas for broadening opportunities for trainee science teachers and early-career science teachers and that makes good use of the support provided by the Science Learning Centre consortia. Additional proposals for focusing on ‘threshold concepts’ and on ‘core representations’ add detail to the proposed programme. It is hoped that the contributions will provoke discussion among the science education community and that the introduction of such a programme will be given serious consideration.
Attributes of Excellence in Practice Educators: the Perspectives of Australian Occupational Therapy Students.	Aim  Occupational therapists frequently undertake the role of practice educator contributing to the development of the future workforce, however, little is known about how they effectively perform this role. This study aimed to elucidate students' perspectives on what makes an excellent practice educator.    Method  Documentation for 124 Practice Excellence Commendations nominations by Queensland occupational therapy students for Queensland Occupational Therapy Fieldwork Collaborative awards between 2008 and 2011 were analysed. These were based on students' experiences on long block placements (five weeks or more) in their later years of undergraduate or masters' entry study. Written nominations addressing five selection criteria were de-identified and responses to each of these compiled. One independent coder and the two lead authors read the transcripts, identified coding categories and reached consensus regarding emerging themes using standard content and thematic analysis techniques.    Results  Providing the ‘just right’ challenge was the overarching theme that symbolised excellence in practice education from students' perspectives. Three themes emerged that enabled practice educators to provide student support needed to balance the challenges of learning on placement; (i) valuing a reciprocal relationship; (ii) facilitating learning opportunities and experiences; and (iii) encouraging autonomy and independence.    Conclusion  Findings provided insights into student perceptions about how excellent practice educators facilitated their learning while on placement. These insights can be used to inform practice educators who wish to enhance their supervision skills. Future research should focus on how the attributes of practice educators positively influence student learning outcomes.
Differences in the Spatial Distribution and Chemical Composition of PM10 between the United Kingdom and Poland	The Fine Resolution Atmospheric Multi-pollutant Exchange Model was used to calculate the spatial distribution and chemical composition of PM10 concentrations for two geographically remote countries in Europe – the United Kingdom (UK) and Poland – for the year 2007. These countries are diverse in terms of pollutant emissions as well as climate conditions. Information on the contribution of natural and anthropogenic as well as national and imported particles in total PM10 concentrations in both countries is presented. The paper shows that the modelled national annual average PM10 concentrations, calculated for the entire country area, is similar for the UK and Poland and close to 12 μg m-3. Secondary inorganic aerosols dominate the total PM10 concentrations in Poland. Primary particulate matter has the greatest contribution to total PM10 in the UK, with large contribution of base cations. Anthropogenic sources predominate (81%) in total PM10 concentrations in Poland, whereas natural prevail in the UK – hence, the future reduction of PM10 air concentrations by emissions reduction could be more difficult in the UK than in Poland.
`Financial Tech` Will Disrupt Business Models Globally.	Financial services is about to experience the redefinition of its traditional business models as the proliferation of Internet-enabled smartphones and four technology platforms in online payments, money transfer, asset management and crowdfunding emerge in global markets. A seismic decline is occurring in the use of high street outlets in developed countries as consumers demand more convenient and easier ways to manage their financial service requirements. In emerging nations, where banking networks often don’t exist, the mobile wallet (M-Pesa) has already become a banking substitute.
CASAM: Collaborative Human-machine Annotation of Multimedia.	The CASAM multimedia annotation system implements a model of cooperative annotation between a human annotator and automated components. The aim is that they work asynchronously but together. The system focuses upon the areas where automated recognition and reasoning are most effective and the user is able to work in the areas where their unique skills are required. The system’s reasoning is influenced by the annotations provided by the user and, similarly, the user can see the system’s work and modify and, implicitly, direct it. The CASAM system interacts with the user by providing a window onto the current state of annotation, and by generating requests for information which are important for the final annotation or to constrain its reasoning. The user can modify the annotation, respond to requests and also add their own annotations. The objective is that the human annotator’s time is used more effectively and that the result is an annotation that is both of higher quality and produced more quickly. This can be especially important in circumstances where the annotator has a very restricted amount of time in which to annotate the document. In this paper we describe our prototype system. We expand upon the techniques used for automatically analysing the multimedia document, for reasoning over the annotations generated and for the generation of an effective interaction with the end-user. We also present the results of evaluations undertaken with media professionals in order to validate the approach and gain feedback to drive further research.
Family-based Childhood Obesity Interventions in the UK: a Systematic Review of Published Studies.	Family-based programmes that emphasise lifestyle and behaviour change using psychological principles have been shown to be effective in targeting childhood obesity. While there is some evidence that evaluates UK family-based obesity interventions at a local level, no review to date has addressed this nationally. This review presents the available evidence from UK family-based childhood obesity interventions. Ten articles that met the inclusion criteria were included for review. The majority of programmes reviewed lasted 12 weeks, with only three studies providing follow-up data at 12 months or longer. Change in adiposity may be a short-term benefit of participation in a child weight management programme, but there is insufficient robust evidence to indicate that this benefit is long lasting and many studies were methodologically weak with limited internal validity. There is insufficient evidence to suggest how the inclusion of parents and the wider family may impact on the effectiveness of UK community based weight management programme for children and young people.
Investigating Schizotypy and Crime-Based Reasoning With Qualitative Methods.	Qualitative data are presented following a series of four studies where participants completed a quantitative reasoning task followed by either an interview or an audio  diary. Qualitative data were analysed using thematic analysis (Braun and Clarke 2006)with three main themes emerging: emotions; reasoning approach; and justifications. High schizotypal scorers demonstrated limited emotional responses compared with low scorers,and where emotions were expressed, individuals made these in relation to themselves rather than the presented scenario. Results contribute to a better understanding of the biases that high-scoring individuals experience and provide further evidence for ‘jump to conclusions’ biases in reasoning about crime.
The Creative Analytic Paradigm and Generative Social Research within the Context of the Early-Years/Kindergarten Physical Learning Environment	Innovative approaches to research methodology are a potential counterbalance to the dominance of established methods and may be more responsive to specific research aims. However, approaching research differently incurs risks associated with evaluation of quality of methods and outcomes. This article starts the process of engaging with key methodological issues to provide a foundation for developing an innovative approach. The starting point is a focus on categorisation theory related to qualitative, quantitative and mixed methods. The article focuses on superordinate, basic and subordinate categories when responding to the stretching boundaries of qualitative research. Attention is then given to the concept of research paradigm; role of research questions; approaches to data collection and analysis; and to assessing quality as some of the starting points for developing an innovative approach. The creative analytic paradigm as a basic category and generative social research as a superordinate category are introduced and exemplified with reference to the early-years/kindergarten learning environment. The article then illustrates a subordinate category research design that involves the burgeoning of experience though time in response to evocative objects from the early-years learning environment. The resulting methodology is a straightforward and manageable form of meaning based reflective practice.
Comparison of Poaceae Pollen Counts Recorded at Sites in Portugal, Spain and the UK	The main aim of this study was to analyse the temporal and spatial variations in grass (Poaceae) pollen counts (2005–2011) recorded in Évora (Portugal), Badajoz (Spain) and Worcester (UK). Weekly average data were examined using nonparametric statistics to compare differences between places. On average, Évora recorded the earliest start dates of the Poaceae pollen seasons and Worcester the latest. The intensity of the Poaceae pollen season varied between sites, with Worcester usually recording the least and Évora the most grass pollen in a season. Mean durations of grass pollen seasons were 77 days in Évora, 78 days in Badajoz and 59 days in Worcester. Overall, longer Poaceae pollen seasons coincided with earlier pollen season start dates. Weekly pollen data, from March to September, from the three pollen-monitoring stations studied were compared. The best fit and most statistically significant correlations were obtained by moving Worcester data backward by 4 weeks (Évora, r = 0.810, p < 0.001) and 5 weeks (Badajoz,r = 0.849, p < 0.001). Weekly data from Worcester therefore followed a similar pattern to that of Badajoz and Évora but at a distance of more than 1,500 km and 4–5 weeks later. The sum of pollen recorded in a season was compared with monthly rainfall between January and May. The strongest positive relationship between season intensity and rainfall was between the annual sum of Poaceae pollen recorded in the season at Badajoz and Évora and total rainfall during January and February. Winter rainfall noticeably affects the intensity of Poaceae pollen seasons in Mediterranean areas, but this was not as important in Worcester.
Identification of Pathways for Bipolar Disorder: a Meta-analysis	Importance:  Genome-wide investigations provide systematic information regarding the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders.    Objective:  To identify biological pathways that contribute to risk for bipolar disorder (BP) using genes with consistent evidence for association in multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS).    Data Sources:  Four independent data sets with individual genome-wide data available in July 2011 along with all data sets contributed to the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Bipolar Group by May 2012. A prior meta-analysis was used as a source for brain gene expression data.    Study Selection:  The 4 published GWAS were included in the initial sample. All independent BP data sets providing genome-wide data in the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium were included as a replication sample.    Data Extraction and Synthesis:  We identified 966 genes that contained 2 or more variants associated with BP at P < .05 in 3 of 4 GWAS data sets (n = 12 127 [5253 cases, 6874 controls]). Simulations using 10 000 replicates of these data sets corrected for gene size and allowed the calculation of an empirical P value for each gene; empirically significant genes were entered into a pathway analysis. Each of these pathways was then tested in the replication sample (n = 8396 [3507 cases, 4889 controls]) using gene set enrichment analysis for single-nucleotide polymorphisms. The 226 genes were also compared with results from a meta-analysis of gene expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.    Main Outcomes and Measures:  Empirically significant genes and biological pathways.    Results:  Among 966 genes, 226 were empirically significant (P < .05). Seventeen pathways were overrepresented in analyses of the initial data set. Six of the 17 pathways were associated with BP in both the initial and replication samples: corticotropin-releasing hormone signaling, cardiac β-adrenergic signaling, phospholipase C signaling, glutamate receptor signaling, endothelin 1 signaling, and cardiac hypertrophy signaling. Among the 226 genes, 9 differed in expression in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in patients with BP: CACNA1C, DTNA, FOXP1, GNG2, ITPR2, LSAMP, NPAS3, NCOA2, and NTRK3.    Conclusions and Relevance:  Pathways involved in the genetic predisposition to BP include hormonal regulation, calcium channels, second messenger systems, and glutamate signaling. Gene expression studies implicate neuronal development pathways as well. These results tend to reinforce specific hypotheses regarding BP neurobiology and may provide clues for new approaches to treatment and prevention.
'It's Almost Like Talking to a Person': Student Discolsure to Pedagogical Agents in Sensitive Setting	Online chatbots (also known as pedagogical agents or virtual assistants) are becoming embedded into the fabric of technology, both in educational and commercial settings. Yet understanding of these technologies is inchoate and often untheorised, influenced by individuals’ willingness to trust technologies, aesthetic appearance of the chatbot and technical literacy, among other factors. This paper draws upon data from two research studies that evaluated students’ experiences of using pedagogical agents in education using responsive evaluation. The findings suggest that emotional connections with pedagogical agents were intrinsic to the user’s sense of trust and therefore likely to affect levels of truthfulness and engagement. They also indicate that the topic of the pedagogical agent-student  interaction is key to the student’s experience. The implications of these studies are that truthfulness, personalisation and emotional engagement are all vital components in using pedagogical agents to enhance online learning.
Generative Divergent Analysis as a Model for Reflection Illustrated with Reference to an Early-years Reception  Class and Wicker Settee	Generative divergent analysis (GDA) is a creative additive approach to raising insignificant details of experience to significance. A schematic view of the model highlights use of evocative objects as starting point for ‘turning towards’, ‘turning away’ and ‘being-in-relation-to’ as part of an ongoing burgeoning of experience.The model is exemplified by focusing on a wicker settee as an evocative  object that was noticed in an early-years reception class. Revisiting the object generated several speculative ideas relating to the hidden curriculum and energies of childhood. Poetry and song were used during the revisiting in order to develop a more direct experience in addition to the more contemplative awareness that was evoked during the first encounters. As an additive process the outcome of GDA takes the form of unfinished resources for thinking.
Student Midwives Views on Incorporating Creative Arts as a Learning Strategy.	This paper reports select findings from an initial study seeking to ascertain student midwives views on incorporating creative arts as a learning strategy into pre-registration midwifery curriculum.  Concern regarding the quality of midwifery practice in relation to supporting mothers has been at the forefront of national news. There has been increasing friction between what student midwives learn about practice and what they witness in practice.   The findings offer insight into whether creative arts is a viable pedagogy to enable students to engage with the emotionality of midwifery practice.   The paper concludes that creative arts should be considered an integrated pedagogy in midwifery education as it goes some way to address the divergence of the art and science of midwifery to ensure graduating students are fit  for purpose.
Identification of Potential Sources of Airborne Olea Pollen in the Southwest Iberian Peninsula	This study aims to determine the potential origin of Olea pollen recorded in Badajoz in the Southwest of the Iberian Peninsula during 2009–2011. This was achieved using a combination of daily average and diurnal (hourly) airborne Olea pollen counts recorded at Badajoz (south-western Spain) and Évora (south-eastern Portugal), an inventory of olive groves in the studied area and air mass trajectory calculations computed using the HYSPLIT model. Examining olive pollen episodes at Badajoz that had distinctly different diurnal cycles in olive pollen in relation to the mean, allowed us to identify three different scenarios where olive pollen can be transported to the city from either distant or nearby sources during conditions with slow air mass movements. Back trajectory analysis showed that olive pollen can be transported to Badajoz from the West on prevailing winds, either directly or on slow moving air masses, and from high densities of olive groves situated to the Southeast (e.g. Andalucía). Regional scale transport of olive pollen can result in increased nighttime concentrations of this important aeroallergen. This could be particularly important in Mediterranean countries where people can be outdoors during this time due to climate and lifestyle. Such studies that examine sources and the atmospheric transport of pollen are valuable for allergy sufferers and health care professionals because the information can be incorporated into forecasts, the outputs of which are used for avoiding exposure to aeroallergens and planning medication. The results of studies of this nature can also be used for examining gene flow in this important agricultural crop.
Elite Rugby Union Players Perceptions of Performance Analysis	This study provides an in depth insight into the current views and opinions of elite level rugby union players regarding the use of performance analysis as a tool for improving their own playing performance and in highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of upcoming opponents. A total of seventy-three elite level rugby union players from two clubs in Great Britain completed a semi-structured questionnaire. Additionally, four players completed a semi-structured interview and following inductive content analysis, four key themes emerged: (1) the use of video for player development, (2) preparing for a match, (3) using video for player reflection in addition to other psychological tools and (4) players suggestions for improvements to the clubs current performance analysis programme. The main finding of the study concludes that players viewed performance analysis as a beneficial and useful tool to support their development and preparation. As a result the study provides an insight into the use of performance analysis within professional rugby union, enabling rugby coaches and practitioners to gain an understanding and appreciation of the players views towards the clubs current provision. Additionally, the findings help build and strengthen the on-going knowledge coaches, analysts and researchers currently have regarding how players perceive performance analysis.
The Unsung Heroes of Programming.	Some key figures in the world of programming who may not be universally recognised.
An Evaluation of the Effectiveness of Recruitment Methods: The Staying Well After Depression Randomized Controlled Trial.	BACKGROUND:  Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are widely accepted as being the most efficient way of investigating the efficacy of psychological therapies. However, researchers conducting RCTs commonly report difficulties in recruiting an adequate sample within planned timescales. In an effort to overcome recruitment difficulties, researchers often are forced to expand their recruitment criteria or extend the recruitment phase, thus increasing costs and delaying publication of results. Research investigating the effectiveness of recruitment strategies is limited, and trials often fail to report sufficient details about the recruitment sources and resources utilized.    PURPOSE:  We examined the efficacy of strategies implemented during the Staying Well after Depression RCT in Oxford to recruit participants with a history of recurrent depression.    METHODS:  We describe eight recruitment methods utilized and two further sources not initiated by the research team and examine their efficacy in terms of (1) the return, including the number of potential participants who contacted the trial and the number who were randomized into the trial; (2) cost-effectiveness, comprising direct financial cost and manpower for initial contacts and randomized participants; and (3) comparison of sociodemographic characteristics of individuals recruited from different sources.    RESULTS: Poster advertising, web-based advertising, and mental health worker referrals were the cheapest methods per randomized participant; however, the ratio of randomized participants to initial contacts differed markedly per source. Advertising online, via posters, and on a local radio station were the most cost-effective recruitment methods for soliciting participants who subsequently were randomized into the trial. Advertising across many sources (saturation) was found to be important.    LIMITATIONS: It may not be feasible to employ all the recruitment methods used in this trial to obtain participation from other populations, such as those currently unwell, or in other geographical locations. Recruitment source was unavailable for participants who could not be reached after the initial contact. Thus, it is possible that the efficiency of certain methods of recruitment was poorer than estimated. Efficacy and costs of other recruitment initiatives, such as providing travel expenses to the in-person eligibility assessment and making follow-up telephone calls to candidates who contacted the recruitment team but could not be screened promptly, were not analysed.    CONCLUSION: Website advertising resulted in the highest number of randomized participants and was the second cheapest method of recruiting. Future research should evaluate the effectiveness of recruitment strategies for other samples to contribute to a comprehensive base of knowledge for future RCTs.
Providing a Positive Learning Experience for International Students Studying at UK Universities: A Literature Review	Much of the current literature relating to international students at university level tends to highlight their  experiences from a deficit perspective and in some cases even problematises the experience for the student  and university. Other studies tend to focus on recruitment and motivation rather than the lived experiences  of the student, thereby providing little assistance to guide the student, academic and host university in  their preparation for, and working with, the international student. International students choose to study  in the United Kingdom for a variety of positive reasons. However, these factors have the potential to  become stressors as the student makes the transition to studying in a foreign country. Rather than viewing  these stressors from a negative perspective, this literature review identifies how, with planning, support and  understanding, universities can provide and develop a positive experience for all concerned.

INBOX: Fathers and Maternity Services (Letter to editor)	A father's experiences of his welcome and inclusion in maternity ward was compared over two occasions which spanned a 30 year period. Conclusions were that he felt as excluded from involvement as he had done 30 years previously. The recommendation was that maternity wards become more inclusive and welcoming of fathers.
Looking for Trouble	Conflict between children is usually seen as something that needs to be avoided or resolved. But, argues Nicola Watson, if we see it as an opportunity to develop emotional and social learning, the benefits to children can be transformative.
Mindfulness-based Cognitive Therapy For Preventing Relapse in Recurrent Depression: A Randomized Dismantling Trial.	Objective: We compared mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) with both cognitive psycholog-ical education (CPE) and treatment as usual (TAU) in preventing relapse to major depressive disorder (MDD) in people currently in remission following at least 3 previous episodes. Method: A randomized controlled trial in which 274 participants were allocated in the ratio 2:2:1 to MBCT plus TAU, CPE plus TAU, and TAU alone, and data were analyzed for the 255 (93%; MBCT 99, CPE 103, TAU 53) retained to follow-up. MBCT was delivered in accordance with its published manual, modified to address suicidal cognitions; CPE was modeled on MBCT, but without training in meditation. Both treatments were delivered through 8 weekly classes. Results: Allocated treatment had no significant effect on risk of relapse to MDD over 12 months follow-up, hazard ratio for MBCT vs. CPE 0.88, 95% CI [0.58, 1.35]; for MBCT vs. TAU 0.69, 95% CI [0.42, 1.12]. However, severity of childhood trauma affected relapse, hazard ratio for increase of 1 standard deviation 1.26 (95% CI [1.05, 1.50]), and significantly interacted with allocated treatment. Among participants above median severity, the hazard ratio was 0.61, 95% CI [0.34, 1.09], for MBCT vs. CPE, and 0.43, 95% CI [0.22, 0.87], for MBCT vs. TAU. For those below median severity, there were no such differences between treatment groups. Conclusion: MBCT provided significant protection against relapse for participants with increased vulnerability due to history of childhood trauma, but showed no significant advantage in comparison to an active control treatment and usual care over the whole group of patients with recurrent depression.
Chat Apps Will Disrupt Global Telecoms Sector	The recent purchase of WhatsApp by Facebook for $19 billion signified a new milestone in the evolution of the mobile Internet as a technology platform. Not only is the new chat app seen as a threat to Facebook’s dominance as the leading social networking platform (hence the astronomical valuation) it is also about to have a highly disruptive impact on the telecoms sector. In just over four years WhatsApp has grown to half the size of Facebook and is projected to reach 1 billion users within the next few years. During this period WhatsApp has destroyed the $120 billion SMS (texting) market and is now planning on disrupting voice mail, the traditional revenue stream of telecoms companies.
Understanding Style, Language and Etiquette in Email Communication in Higher Education: a Survey.	This study investigates academic staff and student attitudes to style and etiquette of emails. Data were collected through two online staff and student surveys. Reported use and acceptability of particular features of email style were assessed. Open-ended responses yielded four themes: the balance between formality and informality, relationships, evolution in communications over time, and mutual expectations. These themes are discussed with reference to linguistic features of email style, theories of accommodation, and politeness studies. Points of guidance to students and staff on appropriate use and construction of email in higher education are indicated.
Improving Responses to Rape and Sexual Assault: Delivering a Victim-Centred System.	Review of a Public Policy Exchange symposium, Broadway House, London,28 November 2013.
Ability Versus Trait Emotional Intelligence: Dual Influences on Adolescent Psychological Adaptation	Emotional intelligence (EI) is reliably associated with better mental health. A growing body of evidence suggests that EI acts as a protective buffer against some psychosocial stressors to promote adaptation. However, little is known about how the two principle forms of EI (trait and ability) work together to impact underlying stressor-health processes in adolescence. One thousand one hundred and seventy British adolescents (mean age = 13.03 years; SD = 1.26) completed a variety of standardized instruments assessing EI; coping styles; family dysfunction; negative life events; socioeconomic adversity; depression and disruptive behavior. Path analyses found that trait and ability EI work in tandem to modify the selection and efficacy of avoidant coping to influence the indirect effect of stressors on depression but not disruptive behavior. Nevertheless, actual emotional skill (ability EI) appears dependent on perceived competency (trait EI) to realize advantageous outcomes. Findings are evaluated and discussed with reference to theoretical and practical implications.
Glacial Geomorphology of the Tweedsmuir Hills, Central Southern Uplands, Scotland	The Quaternary glacial history of the Tweedsmuir Hills, Central Southern Uplands, Scotland,has received little attention since the 1980s, with earlier studies focussing on single lines of geomorphic evidence in isolated valleys. This study presents the first systematic glacial  geomorphological assessment of the region, covering approximately 300 km2 with the map designed to be presented at A0. Mapping from remotely sensed imagery and field investigation reveal a large number of moraines and meltwater channels, both within valleys and occasionally extending to the plateau, alongside a range of peri- and para-glacial features, including solifluction lobes, alluvial fans, debris cones, river terraces and rock  slope failures. Aspects of the mapped geomorphology are consistent with plateau icefield landsystems mapped elsewhere in Britain and this will hopefully form the basis for palaeoglaciological reconstructions which will improve our understanding of the extent and dynamics of former ice masses in the region.
Investigating the Genetic Variation Underlying Episodicity in Major Depressive Disorder: Suggestive Evidence for a Bipolar Contribution	Background:  Highly recurrent major depressive disorder (MDD) has reportedly increased risk of shifting to bipolar disorder; high recurrence frequency has, therefore, featured as evidence of ‘soft bipolarity’. We aimed to investigate the genetic underpinnings of total depressive episode count in recurrent MDD.    Methods:  Our primary sample included 1966 MDD cases with negative family history of bipolar disorder from the RADIANT studies. Total episode count was adjusted for gender, age, MDD duration, study and center before being tested for association with genotype in two separate genome-wide analyses (GWAS), in the full set and in a subset of 1364 cases with positive family history of MDD (FH+). We also calculated polygenic scores from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium MDD and bipolar disorder studies.    Results:  Episodicity (especially intermediate episode counts) was an independent index of MDD familial aggregation, replicating previous reports. The GWAS produced no genome-wide significant findings. The strongest signals were detected in the full set at MAGI1 (p=5.1×10−7), previously associated with bipolar disorder, and in the FH+ subset at STIM1 (p=3.9×10−6 after imputation), a calcium channel signaling gene. However, these findings failed to replicate in an independent Munich cohort. In the full set polygenic profile analyses, MDD polygenes predicted episodicity better than bipolar polygenes; however, in the FH+ subset, both polygenic scores performed similarly.    Limitations:  Episode count was self-reported and, therefore, subject to recall bias.    Conclusions:  Our findings lend preliminary support to the hypothesis that highly recurrent MDD with FH+ is part of a ‘soft bipolar spectrum’ but await replication in larger cohorts.
From National Policies and Sentiments to Local Practices and Subjectivities: Mapping Immigrant Educational Identities in a Semi-Rural Locale.	Given increased trends in globalization, there is a significant lacuna in identity research pertaining to rural or town settings and the impact that such locales have on pupils’ educational identities. The question remains as to whether notions of “othering,” or constraining subjectivities, are adopted and ascribed within schools among more recently arrived immigrant groups. Drawing on critical post-structuralist research, the following article illuminates how an assemblage of policies, power flows, performatives, personalities, bodily interactions, and spaces, operating within and outside of schools at particular times, combined to shape minority ethnic pupils’ social and educational identities in two English primary schools located in a West-Midlands town.

Seasonal Variation in Diurnal Atmospheric Grass Pollen Concentration Profiles	In this study, the diurnal atmospheric grass pollen concentration profile within the Danish city of Aarhus was  shown to change in a systematic manner as the pollen season  progressed. Although diurnal grass pollen profiles can differ greatly from day-to-day, it is common practice to establish the time of day when peak concentrations are most likely to occur using seasonally averaged diurnal profiles. Atmospheric pollen loads are highly dependent upon emissions, and different species of grass are known to flower and emit pollen at different times of the day and during different periods of the pollen season. Pollen concentrations are also influenced by meteorological factors – directly through those parameters that govern pollen dispersion and transport, and indirectly through the weather-driven flowering process. We found that three different profiles dominated the grass pollen season in Aarhus – a twin peak profile during the early season, a single evening profile during the middle of the season, and a single midday peak during the late season. Whilst this variation could not be explained by meteorological factors,  no inconsistencies were found with the theory that it was driven by a succession of different grass species with different diurnal flowering patterns dominating atmospheric pollen loads as the season progressed. The potential for exposure was found to be significantly greater during the late-season period than during either the early- or mid-season periods.
Application of Decision-Making Theory to the Regulation  of Muscular Work Rate During Self-Paced Competitive  Endurance Activity.	Successful participation in competitive endurance  activities requires continual regulation of muscular  work rate in order to maximise physiological performance  capacities, meaning that individuals must make numerous  decisions with regards to the muscular work rate selected at any point in time. Decisions relating to the setting of appropriate goals and the overall strategic approach to be utilised are made prior to the commencement of an event, whereas tactical decisions are made during the event itself. This review examines current theories of decision-making in an attempt to explain the manner in which regulation of muscular work is achieved during athletic activity. We describe rational and heuristic theories, and relate these to current models of regulatory processes during self-paced exercise in an attempt to explain observations made in both laboratory and competitive environments. Additionally, we use rational and heuristic theories in an attempt to explain the influence of the presence of direct competitors on the quality of the decisions made during these activities. We hypothesise that although both rational and heuristic models can plausibly explain many observed behaviours in competitive endurance activities, the complexity of the environment in which such activities occur would imply that effective rational decision-making is unlikely. However, at present, many proposed models of the regulatory process share similarities with rational models. We suggest enhanced understanding of the decision-making process during self-paced activities is crucial in order to improve the ability to understand regulation of performance and performance outcomes during athletic activity.
Back-trajectories Show Export of Airborne Fungal Spores (Ganoderma sp.) From Forests to Agricultural and Urban Areas in England	We propose here the hypothesis that all of United Kingdom (UK) is likely to be affected by Ganoderma sp. spores, an important plant pathogen. We suggest that the main sources of this pathogen, which acts as a bioaerosol, are the widely scattered woodlands in the country, although remote sources must not be neglected. The hypothesis is based on related studies on bioaerosols and supported by new observations from a non-forest site and model calculations to support our hypothesis.    Hourly concentrations of Ganoderma sp. spores were measured from 2006 to 2010 using a 7-day volumetric spore trap at the city of Worcester. The concentrations peak during the night and early in the morning. This suggests that the main spore sources are located a few hours away with respect to air masses transport and reach urban areas thanks to air masses transport.    The back-trajectory analysis was applied to determine the location of Ganoderma sp. spore sources. The analysis of back-trajectories demonstrated that 78% of the air masses reached Worcester from a 180° arc direction from the East to West. Three episodes were selected for detailed investigation and they revealed that during the episodes air masses always passed main UK woodlands before the arrival in Worcester, independently of their origin, but the long distance transport under certain conditions might be possible.    Our studies suggest that the sources of UK Ganoderma sp. spores are mainly to be found in UK. Hence our studies suggest that research and mitigation strategies in UK should give their main attention to national sources, without neglecting the contribution from long distance transport.
Obama Security Reforms will not Help US Tech Firms	A Pew research poll published yesterday found that 73% of respondents did not think that US President Barack Obama’s proposals to reform the National Security Agency (NSA) would enhance privacy rights. Obama on January 17 outlined potential measures to address consumer and business concerns over NSA surveillance operations. The US administration and the NSA’s credibility have suffered since former NSA contractor Edward Snowden revealed extensive US Internet and phone surveillance in June 2013.
Banks Face Rising Global `Crowdfunding` Competition	More than five years after the financial crisis in 2008, small businesses in Western markets are still struggling to borrow money from the banks. However, the combination of the financial crisis and the rapid growth in social networking (Web 2.0) has resulted in the emergence of a new form funding stream known as crowdfunding. This involves the raising of money from large numbers of networked individuals and institutions via the Internet. Crowdfunding is supported by the “platform” which is an intermediary firm (such as Kickstarter or Indiegogo) which brings together the investors (“the crowd”) and a small business wishing to raise finance via a website.  Although this new form of non-bank lending isn’t seen as a threat to the traditional banking system, it does signify a serious alternative to traditional sources of finance for small, medium enterprises.
Occupational Therapists’ Attitudes, Knowledge,and Implementation of Evidence-based Practice: a Systematic Review of Published Research	Introduction: Evidence-based practice is the procedure whereby clinicians incorporate best research evidence, clinical expertise, and patient values to provide best patient care. Recently, there has been a significant push towards occupational therapists’ adoption of evidence-based practice. This systematic review aimed to determine occupational therapists’ attitudes, knowledge, and utilization of evidence-based practice.  Method: A search of literature published between 2000–12 was conducted in relation to occupational therapists’ practice. Academic Search Complete, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature Plus, PsycARTICLES, Ingenta, Medline, Science Direct, and Journal Storage were systematically searched using MeSH and free-text keywords. Google Scholar and reference lists were also searched.  Findings: Thirty-two papers were selected for review: 23 were quantitative, 8 were qualitative, and 1 used a mixed methods design. Studies demonstrated that occupational therapists hold positive attitudes towards evidence-based practice. However, these attitudes do not translate into practice, with research indicating a lack of evidence-based practice utilization. Occupational therapists perceive a number of barriers to evidence-based practice, including lack of time, lack of availability and accessibility of research, and having limited research skills.  Conclusion: It is essential that educational and training initiatives provide therapists with the tools and support they need to engage fully with research evidence and its application within clinical care.
Bitcoin Could Disrupt Traditional Banking Globally	Bitcoin is a virtual currency that has risen from virtual anonymity in 2009 to occupy a high profile position following extensive media coverage during the last twelve months. This media coverage has been partly the reason for the meteoric rise in the value of the currency to over $1,000 dollars. However, despite all the speculative trading of Bitcoins on the global exchanges, there appears to be a robust technology platform emerging in the form of a payment network offering cheaper and faster money transfer than any other options currently in existence. By combining Bitcoins with NFC (near field communication) – enabled smart phones, it is possible to create a new low-cost financial system that will eliminate the need for credit cards and bank accounts.
Improving the Psychometric Utility of the Hypomania Checklist (HCL-32): a Rasch Analysis Approach	Background    The HCL-32 is a widely-used screening questionnaire for hypomania. We aimed to use a Rasch analysis approach to (i) evaluate the measurement properties, principally unidimensionality, of the HCL-32, and (ii) generate a score table to allow researchers to convert raw HCL-32 scores into an interval-level measurement which will be more appropriate for statistical analyses.    Methods    Subjects were part of the Bipolar Disorder Research Network (BDRN) study with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (n=389). Multidimensionality was assessed using the Rasch fit statistics and principle components analysis of the residuals (PCA). Item invariance (differential item functioning, DIF) was tested for gender, bipolar diagnosis and current mental state. Item estimates and reliabilities were calculated.    Results    Three items (29, 30, 32) had unacceptable fit to the Rasch unidimensional model. Item 14 displayed significant DIF for gender and items 8 and 17 for current mental state. Item estimates confirmed that not all items measure hypomania equally.    Limitations    This sample was recruited as part of a large ongoing genetic epidemiology study of bipolar disorder and may not be fully representative of the broader clinical population of individuals with bipolar disorder.    Conclusion    The HCL-32 is unidimensional in practice, but measurements may be further strengthened by the removal of four items. Re-scored linear measurements may be more appropriate for clinical research.
Towards a Better Modelling and Assessment of Construction Risk: Insights from a Literature Review	This paper reviews the literature of construction risk modelling and assessment. It also reviews the real practice of risk assessment. The review resulted in significant results, summarised as follows. There has been a major shift in risk perception from an estimation variance into a project attribute. Although the Probability–Impact risk model is prevailing, substantial efforts are being put to improving it reflecting the increasing complexity of construction projects. The literature lacks a comprehensive assessment approach capable of capturing risk impact on different project objectives. Obtaining a realistic project risk level demands an effective mechanism for aggregating individual risk assessments. The various assessment tools suffer from low take-up; professionals typically rely on their experience. It is concluded that a simple analytical tool that uses risk cost as a common scale and utilises professional experience could be a viable option to facilitate closing the gap between theory and practice of risk assessment.
Effectiveness of Nonpharmacologic Treatments for Acute Seasonal Allergic Conjunctivitis	Objective  To investigate whether artificial tears and cold compress alone or in combination provide a treatment benefit and whether they were as effective as or could enhance topical antiallergic medication.    Design  Randomized, masked clinical trial.    Participants  Eighteen subjects (mean age, 29.5±11.0 years) allergic to grass pollen.    Intervention  Controlled exposure to grass pollen using an environmental chamber to stimulate an ocular allergic reaction followed by application of artificial tears (ATs), 5 minutes of cold compress (CC), ATs combined with CC, or no treatment applied at each separate visit in random order. A subset of 11 subjects also had epinastine hydrochloride (EH) applied alone and combined with CC in random order or instillation of a volume-matched saline control.    Main Outcome Measures  Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia, ocular surface temperature, and ocular symptoms repeated before and every 10 minutes after treatment for 1 hour.    Results  Bulbar conjunctival hyperemia and ocular symptoms decreased and temperature recovered to baseline faster with nonpharmaceutical treatments compared with no treatment (P < 0.05). Artificial tears combined with CC reduced hyperemia more than other treatments (P < 0.05). The treatment effect of EH was enhanced by combining it with a CC (P < 0.001). Cold compress combined with ATs or EH lowered the antigen-raised ocular surface temperature to less than the pre-exposure baseline. Artificial tear instillation alone or CC combined with ATs or EH significantly reduced the temperature (P < 0.05). Cold compress combined with ATs or EH had a similar cooling effect (P > 0.05). At all measurement intervals, symptoms were reduced for both EH and EH combined with CC than CC or ATs alone or in combination (P < 0.014).    Conclusions  After controlled exposure to grass pollen, CC and AT treatment showed a therapeutic effect on the signs and symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis. A CC enhanced the use of EH alone and was the only treatment to reduce symptoms to baseline within 1 hour of antigenic challenge. Signs of allergic conjunctivitis generally were reduced most by a combination of a CC in combination with ATs or EH.
Public Health Guidance to Facilitate Timely Diagnosis of Dementia: ALzheimer's COoperative Valuation in Europe Recommendations.	Objective: ALzheimer’s COoperative Valuation in Europe (ALCOVE) was a Joint Action co-financed by  the European Commission to produce a set of evidence-based recommendations for policymakers on  dementia. This paper reports on timely diagnosis.  Methods: Evidence was reviewed from scientific, policy and qualitative research. An online questionnaire  was completed by experts from 24 European Union countries detailing current practice. An iterative process  with people with dementia, family carers and professionals was utilised to develop recommendations.  Results: Advances in the technical aspects of diagnosis have changed what is understood by early  diagnosis. Although research into preclinical stages is crucial, diagnosing at these very earliest stages  is not recommended as regular practice. On balance, it is suggested that citizens should have access  to accurate diagnosis at a time in the disease process when it can be of most benefit to them. The term  timely diagnosis is used to reflect this. The diagnosis can help citizens and their families make sense of  what is happening and make lifestyle changes and plans for the future. The central principles identified  to maximise benefit and to reduce harm associated with diagnosis at an earlier stage included reducing  stigma about dementia; respecting the rights of the individual; recognising that how the diagnosis is  given will impact on subsequent adjustment and that post diagnostic support are required for the  person and their family. Detailed recommendations are provided for timely detection, the diagnostic  process, complex diagnoses, response to early cognitive changes and workforce.  Conclusions: The recommendations can be utilised at a local, national and European level to benchmark  progress.
Exploring the Spatio-temporal Relationship Between Two Key Aeroallergens and Meteorological Variables in the United Kingdom	Constructing accurate predictive models for grass and birch pollen in the air, the two most important aeroallergens, for areas with variable climate conditions such as the United Kingdom, require better understanding of the relationships between pollen count in the air and meteorological variables. Variations in daily birch and grass pollen counts and their relationship with daily meteorological variables were investigated for nine pollen monitoring sites for the period 2000–2010 in the United Kingdom. An active pollen count sampling method was employed at each of the monitoring stations to sample pollen from the atmosphere. The mechanism of this method is based on the volumetric spore traps of Hirst design (Hirst in Ann Appl Biol 39(2):257–265, 1952). The pollen season (start date, finish date) for grass and birch were determined using a first derivative method. Meteorological variables such as daily rainfall; maximum, minimum and average temperatures; cumulative sum of Sunshine duration; wind speed; and relative humidity were related to the grass and birch pollen counts for the pre-peak, post peak and the entire pollen season. The meteorological variables were correlated with the pollen count data for the following temporal supports: same-day, 1-day prior, 1-day mean prior, 3-day mean prior, 7-day mean prior. The direction of influence (positive/negative) of meteorological variables on pollen count varied for birch and grass, and also varied when the pollen season was treated as a whole season, or was segmented into the pre-peak and post-peak seasons. Maximum temperature, sunshine duration and rainfall were the most important variables influencing the count of grass pollen in the atmosphere. Both maximum temperature (pre-peak) and sunshine produced a strong positive correlation, and rain produced a strong negative correlation with grass pollen count in the air. Similarly, average temperature, wind speed and rainfall were the most important variables influencing the count of birch pollen in the air. Both wind speed and rain produced a negative correlation with birch pollen count in the air and average temperature produced a positive correlation.
The “Quiet Migration”: Is Intercountry Adoption a Successful Intervention in the Lives of Vulnerable Children?	Practitioner’s Keypoints    Based on the reviewed research findings, this paper supports the following arguments:    ·     overall, children adopted internationally can and do thrive in their adoptive countries;    ·     such success is guaranteed by the high commitment of adoptive parents and the availability of post-adoption support services;    ·     there is, however, a lack of evidence-based practice relating to interventions best suited to the needs of these children post-international adoption;    ·     following a globally standardised process and strict protocols may help alleviate illicit activity in international adoptions;    ·     existing guidelines must be tightened to ensure that children are the central focus in intercountry adoption and that their development is not affected by cross-border movement.
Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy (MBCT) For Health Anxiety (Hypochondriasis): Rationale, Implementation and Case Illustration.	Recent research has shown that mindfulness-based cognitive therapy (MBCT) could be a useful alternative approach to the treatment of health anxiety and deserves further investigation. In this paper, we outline the rationale for using MBCT in the treatment of this condition, namely its hypothesised impact on the underlying mechanisms which maintain health anxiety, such as rumination and avoidance, hypervigilance to body sensations and misinterpretation of such sensations. We also describe some of the adaptations which were made to the MBCT protocol for recurrent depression in this trial and discuss the rationale for these adaptations. We use a case example from the trial to illustrate how MBCT was implemented and outline the experience of one of the participants who took part in an 8-week MBCT course. Finally, we detail some of the more general experiences of participants and discuss the advantages and possible limitations of this approach for this population, as well as considering what might be useful avenues to explore in future research.
The Reach, Transferability, and Impact of the  Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire: A Methodological and Narrative Literature Review.	Background: Since the 1990s, evidence-based practice (EBP) has been increasingly emphasized in nursing, but its implementation is still sometimes met with confusion and resistance. Therefore, identifying factors affecting its implementation is crucial. The Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire (EBPQ) was published in 2006, addressing a need for a robust measure of nurses’ practice of, attitudes toward, and knowledge of EBP. The growing body of professionals using the questionnaire means that a review of its reach, transferability, and impact is timely.    Aims: The aims of this review were threefold: (a) identify the situations in which the EBPQ has been used in both published and unpublished research internationally (Reach); (b) collate the psychometric properties of the EBPQ from the research reviewed (Transferability); and (c) discuss  the study’s findings to shed new light on issues facing professionals in implementing EBP, and possible future directions for research (Impact).    Methods: Literature searches on studies reported between 2006 and July 2012 inclusive were conducted using the terms “Evidence-Based Practice Questionnaire” and “EBPQ.” Green, Johnson and Adams’s guidelines for completing narrative literature reviews and Terwee et al.’s framework for reporting questionnaires’ psychometric properties were adopted to ensure rigor.    Findings: Twenty-seven studies were reviewed in which the EBPQ had been translated into five different languages and used with a variety of professional groups. The questionnaire demonstrated convergent and discriminant validity and good internal reliability. Research adopting the questionnaire identified a range of variables related to EBP implementation, including qualification route and job role.    Linking Evidence to Action: Assessment of organizational culture and workforce training needs prior to developing educational interventions is crucial. The EBPQ has the potential to provide further understanding of these and other issues faced by professionals when implementing EBP.
Review Article: Anthropology and the Biblical Exile	Over the past three decades there have been a few attempts to use social anthropology to explore the Old Testament (OT) and interdisciplinary studies of this sort are now becoming more mainstream. Historical and archaeological data concerning ancient societies are necessarily limited in scope, and anthropological comparisons may offer insights into historical peoples who cannot be observed. This article discusses recent trends in post-exilic studies, in particular those appealing to anthropology.
Embryonic Development in the Ostrich (Struthio camelus) During the First 7 Days of Artificial Incubation.	1. Early development of ostrich embryos was investigated in relation to time of egg collection  and genotype.  2. A total of 321 ostrich eggs were collected during the 2008 and 2009 breeding seasons and the  development of the embryo for up to the first 168 h of incubation was described and analysed. A sample  of the incubated eggs was weighed and opened daily to investigate developmental changes.  3. In fresh eggs, the blastoderm contained a round, translucent dark area pellucida (AP) in the centre,  with a surrounding thin white ring, likely to be the beginning of the area opaca (AO). Fresh eggs were  considered infertile if the blastoderm was absent and instead numerous white droplets were present  surrounded by vacuoles.  4. The average blastoderm area of a fresh fertile egg was 15.8 mm2, increasing to 143.3 mm2 after 2 d of  incubation. By 72 h of incubation the area vasculosa (AV) was discernible in the posterior half of the  blastoderm.  5. At 48 h of incubation the blastoderm area in eggs from the South African Black genotype  (SAB) × Zimbabwean Blue genotype (ZB) crosses (104.5 ± 18.6 mm2) was lower than the pure SAB  (141.0 ± 10.5 mm2), ZB (161.7 ± 13.5 mm2) and ZB × SAB crosses (166.1 ± 14.2 mm2).  6. Embryo length was 5.01 mm after 72 h of incubation and 14.5 mm after 168 h of incubation. At 168 h of  incubation AV lengths for both ZB × SAB (53.2 mm) and SAB × ZB crosses (54.1 mm) were longer than in  embryos from the pure breeds.  7. Results from this study can be put to practical use when determining whether eggs are infertile or  fertile and also in investigating the age of early embryonic mortalities.
The Cost-Effectiveness of Wound Dressings	The current economic downturn in the UK and other countries has caused healthcare organisations  to justify the costs of more advanced technologies. This is seen especially within the wound care  discipline. The costs of healthcare account for a third of all UK government spend and with the  prevalence of chronic wounds increasing, the cost of modern wound care is becoming more  strained and open to scrutiny. Healthcare decision makers should not base their decisions on cost  of dressings alone, but take into account the costs mitigated by using an advanced wound therapy.  A clinical-economic assessment should be performed on a number of advanced therapies to assess  if these are indeed more cost-effective long-term.
Talk: Using Dialogic Talk in Science	This short article seeks to outline the value of talk in the promotion of teaching in primary science.
Monopoly, Power and Politics in Fleet Street: the Controversial Birth of IPC Magazines, 1958-63.	Britain’s newspaper and magazine publishing business did not fare particularly well during the 1950s. With leading newspaper proprietors placing their desire for political influence above that of financial performance, and with working practices in Fleet Street becoming virtually ungovernable, it was little surprise to find many leading periodical publishers on the verge of bankruptcy by the decade’s end. A notable exception to this general picture of financial mismanagement was provided by the chain of enterprises controlled by Roy Thomson. Having first established a base in Scotland in 1953 through the acquisition of the Scotsman newspaper publishing group, the Canadian entrepreneur brought a new commercial attitude and business strategy to bear on Britain’s periodical publishing industry. Using profits generated by a string of successful media activities, in 1959 Thomson bought a place in Fleet Street through the acquisition of Lord Kemsley’s chain of newspapers, which included the prestigious Sunday Times.   Early in 1961 Thomson came to an agreement with Christopher Chancellor, the recently appointed Chief Executive of Odhams Press, to merge their two publishing groups and thereby create a major new force in the British newspaper and magazine publishing industry. The deal was never consummated however. Within days of publicly announcing the merger, Odhams found its shareholders being seduced by an improved offer from Cecil King, Chairman of Daily Mirror Newspapers, Ltd., which they duly accepted. The Mirror’s acquisition of Odhams was deeply controversial, mainly because it brought under common ownership the two left-leaning British popular newspapers, the Mirror and the Herald. Our paper utilises archive sources from the Cabinet Office to explore the political dialogue that enabled the controversial takeover to proceed unopposed by the regulatory authority of the Monopolies Commission. In business terms, it analyses the implication of the successful prosecution of the King-led deal for magazine publishing in Britain: namely, the creation of a virtual monopoly through the formation of the Mirror-controlled IPC Magazines.
A Systematic Review of the Drive for Muscularity Research Area	Abstract  The purpose of the current article was to perform a systematic review of 52 studies in which the drive for muscularity (DFM) has been measured. We included all the papers we found published from 2000 until May 2012. Variables most consistently related to DFM are (1) gender, with males reporting higher levels than females; (2) anxiety and body shame; (3) perceptions that the ideal physique involves high muscularity; (4) behaviours associated with increasing muscularity, including dietary manipulation and resistance training; and (5) the internalisation of a muscular physique as the standard to which to aspire. The DFM was inconsistently correlated with self-esteem, physical characteristics and actual-ideal discrepancies. Research has focused on white male students and been cross-sectional and descriptive. Further theory-driven work is needed with a wider range of populations to enhance the conceptualisation, measurement and understanding of the DFM.
Chess, Contest and English	This article reports on an ethnographic analysis of students who play chess at a mixed Comprehensive school in England. We explore how children learn when playing chess and speculate about how the appeal of the game could be utilised by secondary teachers to improve English lessons.
Clinical Relevance of Corylus Pollen in Poznan, Western Poland	Abstract    Background. In Central Europe, hazel (Corylus sp.) pollen is considered to be an important aeroallergen in early spring.    Objective. This study examines hazel pollen levels in Poznań, western Poland, and the clinical relevance of this aeroallergen  in the city.    Methods. Corylus pollen data (1996–2010) were obtained by volumetric spore trap located near the centre of Poznań.  Clinical data (2006–2010), i.e. skin prick test (SPT) and allergen-specific IgE measurements (asIgE), were supplied by the Allergy Diseases Diagnostic Centre in Poznań.    Results. Mean diurnal hazel pollen concentrations peaked around 14:00–16:00 when mean bi-hourly pollen concentrations were ~60 P m-3. Onset of the hazel pollen season varied up to 87 days annually, and was significantly (r=–0.647; p<0.01) related to mean maximum temperature during late December. SPT data revealed that ~11% of allergy patients had positive  skin reactions to Corylus pollen allergens, and most of these (94.4%) reacted to pollen allergens from other members of  the Betulaceae family – alder or birch. Of those sensitized, 53% suffered from atopic dermatitis. Of patients examined for serum asIgE, 26.0% had asIgE measurements in classes 5 and 6.    Conclusions. Hazel pollen has a detrimental effect on the allergic population of Poznań, with more than half of those sensitised to hazel pollen allergens showing symptoms of atopic dermatitis. Hazel pollen concentrations reach levels recognized as being able to induce allergy symptoms, especially in the afternoon and early evening when many people are returning home from work. The cross-reactivity with other members of the Fagales order also increases the allergenic  potential of hazel pollen.
Aligning Olympic Education With the Liberal Arts: a Curriculum Blueprint From Taiwan	Background: For some time the Olympics have enjoyed a relatively cosy, and quite unsurprising, relationship with Physical Education and its practitioners. Yet, as academics continue their critiques of all matters Olympic, this seemingly symbiotic partnership is being placed under much closer scrutiny. The debates are typically orientated around several key concerns, namely, the vagaries of Olympic discourse, the implicit assumptions that align Olympic idealism with ‘good’ moral education, the relevance of Olympic values in young peoples' lives, the Olympic industry's politicizing/colonizing of educational domains, and the utility of Olympic ideals for affecting social, cultural, and (physical) educational change. One other discussion thread, which we add to in this paper, has been the (in)congruencies between Olympic idealism and non-Western cultural contexts and educational frameworks. Combined, the scholarly voices essentially encourage theorists and practitioners to approach the relationship between education and the Olympics with care.    Context and curriculum overview: Cognizant of these contentions, this paper exhibits an Olympic education curriculum for first-year undergraduate students enrolled within a provincial Taiwanese University's Liberal Arts programme. We detail three tentative themes around which an Olympic education curriculum might be constructed: Peace, Multiculturalism, and Global sensibilities. These particular themes are concomitant with Olympic idealism, but also align with contemporary East Asian Liberal Arts frameworks. In our curriculum design, the emphasis is on developing an Olympic education that not only introduces students to broader global ideas (e.g. universality and cosmopolitan citizenry), but that respects and reflects national/localized specificities (e.g. Asian philosophical traditions and their legacies in educational institutions).    Considerations: The paper stresses the need to further Olympic debates outside the traditional domains of sport and Physical Education, and continue the challenge to Western-orientated sport pedagogies. Our intention is to create a strong cross-cultural study Olympic-inspired Liberal Arts programme that may better link tertiary students in Taiwan with key sport institutions in East Asia, and also throughout the wider communities around the world. We envision aspects of our course material may hopefully serve as a useful reference for other teachers and provide a blueprint for future curricula that might challenge Western-Olympic education orientations.
Role of the Penetration-resistance Genes PEN1, PEN2 and PEN3 in the Hypersensitive Response and Race-specific Resistance in Arabidopsis Thaliana	Plants are highly capable of recognizing and defending themselves against invading microbes. Adapted plant pathogens secrete effector molecules to suppress the host's immune system. These molecules may be recognized by host-encoded resistance proteins, which then trigger defense in the form of the hypersensitive response (HR) leading to programmed cell death of the host tissue at the infection site. The three proteins PEN1, PEN2 and PEN3 have been found to act as central components in cell wall-based defense against the non-adapted powdery mildew Blumeria graminis fsp. hordei (Bgh). We found that loss of function mutations in any of the three PEN genes cause decreased hypersensitive cell death triggered by recognition of effectors from oomycete and bacterial pathogens in Arabidopsis. There were considerable additive effects of the mutations. The HR induced by recognition of AvrRpm1 was almost completely abolished in the pen2 pen3 and pen1 pen3 double mutants and the loss of cell death could be linked to indole glucosinolate breakdown products. However, the loss of the HR in pen double mutants did not affect the plants' ability to restrict bacterial growth, whereas resistance to avirulent isolates of the oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis was strongly compromised. In contrast, the double and triple mutants demonstrated varying degrees of run-away cell death in response to Bgh. Taken together, our results indicate that the three genes PEN1, PEN2 and PEN3 extend in functionality beyond their previously recognized functions in cell wall-based defense against non-host pathogens.
The Influence of the Five Factor Model of Personality on the Perceived Effectiveness of Executive Coaching.	Limited research attention has been paid to the influences on executive coaching effectiveness. This study explores whether a relationship exists between the Five Factor Model of personality and coachee perceptions of effectiveness of executive coaching. Thirty coachees completed a cross sectional survey measuring personality using scales from the International Personality Item Pool (Goldberg, 1999). There was a significant positive relationship between extraversion and perceived coaching effectiveness. The findings have implications for organisations when considering whether their employees are suited to the development interventions on offer and whether the intervention will subsequently provide a good return on investment. Our study also contributes to the emerging literature on antecedents of coaching effectiveness by examining core aspects of individual differences.
The Simon Task and Aging: Does Acute Moderate Exercise Influence Cognitive Control?	Purpose: This study aimed to investigate the influence of an acute bout of moderate exercise and examine the potential lasting improvements over time in young and old adults within the same experimental paradigm over a 2-h testing period. The study was designed to assess the efficiency of selective control and the propensity to make fast impulsive reactions through the analyses of the percentage of correct responses (CAF) and the magnitude of the interference effect (delta curve) as a function of the latency of the response. Methods: Twelve young (23 T 2 yr) and 12 old (63 T 2 yr) volunteers performed the Simon task while cycling (30 min of cycling at 65% of age-predicted HRmax) and after exercise cessation (post 5 min, post 35 min, and post 65 min). Results: Results showed that exercise did not alter cognitive control. The benefit on reaction time performance was evident for both age groups and persisted after cessation for 15–20 min. Distributional analyses showed that younger people have a higher propensity to commit impulsive errors during exercise, which was not evident in older adults. Older adults adopted  more cautious strategies, especially when the risk to commit an error was elevated. Despite the larger mean interference effect compared to younger adults, the pattern of the delta curves attests to the existence of an efficient cognitive control in older people. Conclusions: This study illustrates the effectiveness of distributional analyses and supports the idea that exercise-induced facilitation on cognitive performance can be realized across the lifespan. Future investigations should explore whether accumulated bouts of acute exercise could display an aggregate cognitive benefit, which may significantly affect independent functioning in older adults.
Life after Rugby: Issues of Being an ‘Ex’ in Fiji Rugby.	Rugby has given Fiji international recognition and reputation. Not only is rugby a source of national pride but it has also become a valuable export, with an estimated 500 Fijian players currently in foreign leagues in, for instance, New Zealand, Australia, France, England and Japan. The economic and socio-cultural gains from rugby migration are often considerable, and consequently, many players in Fiji aspire to secure foreign club contracts as their personal and professional goal. However, little is known about the realities and challenges of the players’ life after their active playing career, the burden of which falls largely upon informal, community/family-based support networks. Such informal structures are increasingly under strain especially in urban areas and, faced with a lack of formal structural support mechanisms, many retired athletes experience a number of socio-economic and emotional problems. Some negotiate their post-rugby life successfully while many struggle with becoming and being an ‘ex’. Based on semi-structured interviews, the present paper explores these athletes’ experiences of “life after rugby” and illuminates the local as well as international neoliberal power dynamics that intersects Fiji rugby.
Teachers’ Constructs Of Effective Classroom Practice: Variations Across Career Phases.	This paper outlines a theoretical framework which offers an explanation of the complexity of how teachers define their effectiveness in relation to their classroom practice. The research from which this framework emerged was a two-year, mixed method study of 81 primary and secondary school teachers. The use of repertory grid interviews combined with a number of other methods is unique in a study of teachers’ practice and, from the elicited constructs, seven key themes emerged. These themes, analysed in relation to three broad career phases, indicate a number of issues important for teachers as they transfer from early-to-late career.
The Use of a Computer-Based Simulation Game (CSG) for Learning and Teaching	Introduction  A computer-based simulation game (CSG) was used for the first time in a final-year undergraduate module. A change management simulation game was used in the seminar classes as a formative exercise that was linked to parts of the students’ summative assessment. The module evaluation suggests that most students learned from using the CSG.
Performance Progress and Leadership Behavior	The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between athletes’ perceptions of their coaches’  leadership behaviours and their rating of their own satisfaction with their performance progress whilst under  the guidance of this coach. Participants were 120 competitive athletes (M age = 20.3 years, SD =4.6) from  different individual sports. Participants completed the Leadership Scale for Sports (LSS) and rated their own  perceived satisfaction with their own performance progress underneath their present coach on a scale of 1  ‘extremely dissatisfied’ to 7 ‘extremely satisfied’. A one-way ANOVA analyses was used to test the differences  between three composite satisfaction categories of ‘not satisfied (1-4)’, ‘satisfied’ (5) and ‘more than  satisfied’ (6-7). The results indicate that the athletes who are most satisfied with their performance progress,  evaluate their coaches’ leadership behavior higher in the following domains: Training and Instruction,  Democratic behavior, Social Support, and Positive Feedback. Findings from the present study highlight the  importance of coaches’ training and instruction behavior. The present study also highlights that the  coach-athlete relationship must entail elements of reciprocity, trust, as well as being of a genuine and  helping nature, and that coach’s democratic behaviour, supportive style and their ability to give positive  feedback seem to support such values.
Constructing Professional Identity - the Experience of  Work Based Learning Candidates	Previous research into professional identity has argued that training institutions shape professional formation. This research focuses on professionals who have undertaken a work based approach and explores the interrelationship between practitioners’ own narrative of professional identity and that encoded within the narrative of the standards of a professional HR/HRD body. The findings begin to question the traditional understanding of the inter-relationship between the narrative of the professional body and individual HR/HRD practitioner narratives of identity suggesting that neither the professional body nor the mainstream educational institution are the major players in the development of professional identity.
Managing Patient-to-patient Interaction: the Waiting Room Experience	This article introduces the topic of how patient-to-patient interaction can take many forms in healthcare settings. It provides many illustrations of such interactions, and examines patient confidentiality and the fairness of waiting in detail. Healthcare practitioners need to be professionals in managing patient-to-patient interactions as well as employee-to-patient interactions.
Explicit Prior Knowledge of Social Loafing Does Not Reduce Social Loafing in Subsequent Team Cycle Trial Performance.	The aim of this study was to investigate whether explicit prior knowledge of the social loafing phenomenon,imparted through a specially designed social loafing awareness module, would reduce subsequent social loafing in a team cycle trial competition. Twenty-seven participants were tested individually for the distance covered in a 1-minute cycle trial and then randomly assigned to either a control (n=13) or intervention (n=14) condition. The intervention group completed a 15-minute social loafing awareness module consisting of a lecture and an educational video. Both groups completed a second 1-minute cycle trial in teams. A 2x2 repeated measures ANOVA identified no interaction or main effects (p<.05), suggesting that the module had not reduced social loafing significan tly in the intervention group. Further research is required that would incorporate identification of the initial levels of knowledge of social loafing and explicitly measure   the increase in social loafing awareness following participation in the intervention module.
Relative Efficiencies of the Burkard 7-Day, Rotorod and Burkard Personal Samplers for Poaceae and Urticaceae Pollen under Field Conditions	Introduction: In aerobiological studies it is often necessary to compare concentration data recorded with different models of sampling instrument. Sampler efficiency typically varies from device to device, and depends on the target aerosol and local atmospheric conditions. To account for these differences inter-sampler correction factors may be applied, however for many pollen samplers and pollen taxa such correction factors do not exist and cannot be derived from existing published work. Materials and methods: In this study the relative efficiencies of the Burkard 7-Day Recording Volumetric Spore Trap, the Sampling Technologies Rotorod Model 20 and the Burkard Personal Volumetric Air Sampler were evaluated for Urticaceae and Poaceae pollen under ﬁeld conditions, and the inﬂuence of wind speed and relative humidity on these efficiency relationships was assessed. Data for the two pollen taxa were collected during 2010 and 2011-12 respectively. Results: The three devices were found to record signiﬁcantly different concentrations for both pollen taxa, with the exception of the 7-Day and Rotorod samplers for Poaceae pollen. Under the range of conditions present during the study wind speed was found to only have a signiﬁcant impact on inter-sampler relationships involving the vertically orientated Burkard Personal sampler, whilst no interaction between relative efficiency and relative humidity was observed. Conclusions: Data collected with the three models of sampler should only be compared once the appropriate correction has been made, with wind speed taken into account where appropriate.
Leading by Example: an Examination of Early Education Foundation Degree Students Completing Research Dissertations.	The research was carried out in collaboration with student-practitioners following a part-time Foundation Degree (FdA) in Early Childhood Education and Care, (ECEC). It concentrates on the final phase of the degree programme which requires the presentation of a practice based inquiry (Dissertation) carried out within a workplace setting. The pedagogy underpinning the process is explained in terms of key teaching and learning strategies. A qualitative approach was adopted using content analysis, relational analysis and interviews with students to gather information. This revealed how the practice based focus of the dissertations encompassed both structural and process features of quality improvement. It exposed the value of collaborative engagement and how the process of practice based inquiry influenced and shaped personal and professional refinements to practice. Discussion considers how engaging in practice based inquiry incorporated a number of features associated with leading and developing early childhood practice.
Micro-Oscillations in Positive and Megative Affect During Competitive Laboratory Cycle Time Trials – a Preliminary Study	Background. Incorporating pre-performance or retrospective recall measurement methods, research shows positive and negative affect to operate as both a precursor to performance and as a consequence of performance in line with goal achievement. The extent of this affective change within sport is unclear as measurement of affect within acute settings has yet to be fully adopted.   Objective. To conduct exploratory research examining affect and goal achievement during self paced cycling to further understand their role during performance.  Methods. The Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS; Watson, Clark & Tellegen, 1988), Worcester Affect Scale (WAS; Rhoden & West, 2010) and ratings of goal achievement were completed by 7 trained cyclists prior to two separate 20 km laboratory time trials. The WAS and ratings of goal achievement were also rated during each trial.  Results. Micro oscillations in affect occurred throughout time trials and to a greater degree where participants were unsuccessful in reaching their goals. Successful trials were characterised by higher positive affect (p = 0.000) and lower negative affect (p = 0.000) with higher goal expectations from the start (p = 0.008).  Conclusion. In unsuccessful trials an overly aggressive start, perhaps due to inaccurate goal setting, led to the cyclists’ inability to maintain performance with reductions in power output. Further clarification of the catalyst to the performance demise requires analysis of psychological and physiological parameters in parallel. In so doing, a greater understanding of the combined role of affect and goal expectation in pacing and performance will ensue; a benefit to both cyclist and coach alike.
The Effect of Pedometer Step Goal, Feedback and Self-Monitoring Interventions on Accelerometer-Measured Physical Activity in Children.	This study assessed the utility of 3-week goal-setting, self-monitoring and step-feedback pedometer interventions for increasing physical activity (PA) in children, and the relative impact of individual and group-standardised goals. Three classes of primary school children (n = 68) were randomised to: (a) individual-standardised goal (IS), (b) group-standardised goal (GS) or (c) open pedometer control (CON) groups. PA was assessed via accelerometry (baseline and end-point). There were no main effects for study group, but there was an interaction between time and group for moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), with MVPA time change differing between IS and CON, as MVPA increased in IS but decreased in CON. Mean plots showed MVPA increased in less-active children allocated IS goals, but decreased in GS children. MVPA in more-active children did not change in IS, but declined in GS and CON. Goal-setting, self-monitoring and step-feedback pedometer interventions did not modify PA. Individual-standardised goals may, however, have utility due to mitigating the decline in MVPA in more-active and increasing MVPA in less-active children.
Polygenic Dissection of Diagnosis and Clinical Dimensions of Bipolar Disorder and Schizophrenia	Bipolar disorder and schizophrenia are two often severe disorders with high heritabilities. Recent studies have demonstrated a large overlap of genetic risk loci between these disorders but diagnostic and molecular distinctions still remain. Here, we perform a combined genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 19 779 bipolar disorder (BP) and schizophrenia (SCZ) cases versus 19 423 controls, in addition to a direct comparison GWAS of 7129 SCZ cases versus 9252 BP cases. In our case–control analysis, we identify five previously identified regions reaching genome-wide significance (CACNA1C, IFI44L, MHC, TRANK1 and MAD1L1) and a novel locus near PIK3C2A. We create a polygenic risk score that is significantly different between BP and SCZ and show a significant correlation between a BP polygenic risk score and the clinical dimension of mania in SCZ patients. Our results indicate that first, combining diseases with similar genetic risk profiles improves power to detect shared risk loci and second, that future direct comparisons of BP and SCZ are likely to identify loci with significant differential effects. Identifying these loci should aid in the fundamental understanding of how these diseases differ biologically. These findings also indicate that combining clinical symptom dimensions and polygenic signatures could provide additional information that may someday be used clinically.
Using Problem-based Learning: New Constellations for the 21st Century.	The author argues that there is still too much teaching to the test, and the consequence is growing constellations of problem-based learning (PBL). Today, what passes for PBL practice often seems more like guidelines than any kind of reasoned pedagogy. While at one level the range of variations shows the value and flexibility of PBL as an accommodating, adaptable, and culturally relevant approach to learning, there is relatively little understanding of  the impact of these different constellations on student engagement and learning. Nevertheless, these diverse constellations of PBL need to be delineated and understood. The author outlines the constellations, but also suggests that there are a number of issues that have not been considered in relation to the use of PBL.
Personality Trait Differences Between Traditional and Social Entrepreneurs	Purpose  This research seeks to identify personality trait differences between social and traditional entrepreneurs.     Design/Methodology   The Durham Business School’s General Enterprise Tendencies (GET) test was chosen to measure an individual’s entrepreneurial personality. The choice was based on the test’s established use within industry and its ability to measure traits most commonly considered ‘entrepreneurial’ by the extant literature. The test was adapted for this study and distributed to both social and traditional entrepreneurs. The results were then statistically analysed to test for significant differences between the two groups.    Findings    It was found that social entrepreneurs exhibited statistically significantly higher levels of creativity, risk taking, and need for autonomy than traditional entrepreneurs. The results were then discussed critically in light of the literature.     Limitations  The modest sample size was the main limitation of the research. In addition, the sample set was fairly culturally homogeneous. It has been recommended that an additional test be carried out with a larger sample size, consisting of a more culturally diverse range of participants, in order to improve the generalisation of the findings.    Originality/Value   This research provides new insights into personality trait differences between social and traditional entrepreneurs and is particularly useful to those with an interest in entrepreneurial orientation and those interested in the identification and development of social entrepreneurs.
The Complexity of Leading in Sport: Examining the Role of Domain Expertise in Assessing Leader Credibility and Prototypicality.	The way in which leaders in sport organizations are evaluated by their employees is dependent upon perceived levels of credibility and implicit theories of leadership. Leader knowledge and expertise play significant roles in this process, yet both have been treated as comprehensive constructs irrespective of specific knowledge domains. Drawing from the education literature, this research looks to disentangle the global perspective used by the credibility and prototypicality literatures. It is proposed that employees in sport organizations expect managers to possess domain-specific expertise which is separate from the functional area requirement. Two different samples including professional sport employees and sport management students were used, with confirmatory factor and conjoint analyses used to test the research hypotheses. The results support the notion that distinct psychological processes exist within sport organizations, and that sport domain knowledge and expertise are distinct constructs which play important roles in the perception of leaders within this context.
Drive for Muscularity and Social Physique Anxiety Mediate the Perceived Ideal Physique Muscle Dysmorphia Relationship.	This study examined the mediating role of drive for muscularity and social physique anxiety in the perceived muscular male ideal physique and muscle dysmorphia relationship in weight training males. Males (N = 146, Mean +/- SD; age 22.8 +/- 5.0 years; weight 82.0 +/- 11.1 kgs; height 1.80 +/- 6.8 m; BMI 25.1 +/- 3.0) who participated in weight training completed validated questionnaires measuring drive for muscularity, social physique anxiety, perceived muscular male ideal physique, global muscle dysmorphia, and several characteristics of muscle dysmorphia (exercise dependence, diet manipulation, concerns about size/symmetry, physique protection behavior, and supplementation). Perceived ideal physique was an independent predictor of muscle dysmorphia measures except physique protection (coefficients = .113-.149, p < .05). Perceived ideal physique also predicted muscle dysmorphia characteristics (except physique protection and diet) via the indirect drive for muscularity pathway (coefficients = .055-.116, p < .05). Perceived ideal physique also predicted size/symmetry concerns and physique protection via the indirect drive for muscularity and social physique anxiety pathway (coefficients = .080-.025, p < .05). These results extend current research by providing insights into the way correlates of muscle dysmorphia interact to predict the condition. The results also highlight signals (e.g., anxiety about muscularity) that strength and conditioning coaches can use to identify at risk people who may benefit from being referred for psychological assistance.
Heart Rate Responses of Referees During the 2011   Eurobasket Championship.	The purpose of the study was to describe heart rate responses of referees during a major international  basketball championship. Heart rate (HR) data was collected from 26 international referees officiating 48 matches (95 matches ‘worth’ of data) at the 2011 Eurobasket Championship. HR was subsequently normalised to percentage of theoretical maximum, and used to calculate time spent in different exercise intensity zones (Light, moderate, heavy, very heavy) across successive phases of the tournament and   successive quarters (Q) of matches. Mean HR was 81.89±13.4% of theoretical maximum during match play, and there were no significant differences in HR recorded during different phases of the championship. However, relative HR progressively decreased with each quarter of the matches (Q1; 91.43±7.6%, Q2;90.51±7.1%, Q3; 88.23±7.3%, Q4; 88.21±7.5% HRmax). This decrease in %HRmax recorded relative to Q1 reached statistical significance (P<0.05) in Q3 and Q4. Although percentage of total match time spent in   ‘hard’ and ‘light’ exercise intensity categories remained similar across quarters of matches, there was a   reduction in time spent in ‘very hard’ activity from 10.93±16.08% in Q1 to 5.73±10.36% in Q3 and 5.55±10.74% in Q4 (both P<0.05). This reduction in ‘very hard’ activity was accompanied by an increase in ‘moderate’ intensity activity from 15.06±14.29% in Q1 to 23.37±17.12% in Q3 and 24.35±20.31% in Q4 (both P<0.01). The data suggests that international basketball referees are unable to maintain initial exercise intensity for four successive quarters of championship play. This is in contrast to available data   suggesting elite players are able to maintain or increase exercise intensity as matches progress. This has   implications for the physical conditioning requirements of international level match officials.
Stress and Coping in IAPT Staff: A Mixed Methods Study	Background: Research indicates National Health Service (NHS) mental health workers have particularly high levels of stress. Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) is an NHS mental health service with new ways of working. Aims: This exploratory study sought to investigate whether IAPT staff experience high levels of stress and, moreover, identify sources of stress and ways of coping.  Method: A mixed methods design was utilised. Forty four IAPT workers completed a quantitative survey in which prevalence of stress (GHQ-12) and dispositional coping styles (COPE) were measured. Qualitative interviews were conducted with 6 staff and analysed using thematic analysis.  Results: Almost 30% of IAPT staff reached criteria for minor psychiatric morbidity. Identified stressors included high volume and target orientated work, constant change, resource issues, team dynamics, demands of high stakes in-service training, managing and holding distress and risk, and home-work conflict. Greater engagement in acceptance and active coping styles related to lower stress, whereas focusing on and venting emotions related to higher stress.  Conclusions: Stress is an issue for IAPT staff, with newly reported stressors including emphasis on targets and high stakes in-service training. Interventions aimed at promoting acceptance and active coping may be beneficial.
'Anyone but England'? Exploring Anti-English Sentiment as Part of Scottish National Identity in Sport.	This article explores the reasons behind the expression of anti-English sentiment by Scots in relation to both sporting and wider social contexts, whilst also considering the impact of migration to England on the attitudes expressed by members of the Scottish diaspora. Drawing upon the conceptual framework of ‘narrative identity’ proposed elsewhere, data was generated through semi-structured interviews which focused upon the ‘ontological’ and ‘public’ narratives of Scottish identity as expressed by Scots living in England. The findings demonstrate the influence of a wide range of personal, social, historical and political factors in highlighting the cleavage between Scotland and England within the context of sport and society, allowing for a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationship between these two nations in the context of sporting rivalry. This relationship is argued to be heavily influenced by the existence of an ‘underdog mentality’-style grand ‘public narrative’ for Scots in relation to their English neighbours, based on perceived differences in economic and sporting resources between the two countries. This ‘underdog mentality’ therefore acts as a legitimating force for the expression of anti-English sentiment in both a sporting and wider social context as part of some individuals’ ‘ontological narrative’, although the extent of such sentiment was found to vary significantly between individuals and contrasting contexts.
Using Theatre and Performance for Promoting Health and Wellbeing Amongst the 50+ Community: An Arts-informed Evaluation.	There is increasing interest in the use of arts-based media to improve the health and wellbeing of the older  population. Whilst there have been a number of initiatives in this area, there have been relatively few arts-informed  evaluations of such interventions. This paper worked with a local theatre to design an evaluation that was an arts-based  intervention. What is novel about the approach adopted here is that not only was the study user-guided, but the study also adopted a new and emerging form of arts-informed inquiry, which offered clarity to the evaluation that is not seen in some of the earlier methods available. The findings of the study indicate that theatre and performance provided opportunities for diverse marginalised members of a community to connect and participate in a shared activity and transform their views of themselves and others in ways that were beneficial for health and wellbeing.
Internationalization’s Effect on Marketing Learning: A Study of Syrian Firms	The aim of the present study is to understand the effects of international expansion on firms’ acquisition of marketing learning. This study’s focus on marketing learning complements previous research on the impact of internationalization on the development of foreign-market and technological knowledge. The research finds that the scope of a firm’s international activities, perception of gaps in marketing knowledge, and external social capital positively influence firms’ acquisition of marketing learning. However, firm’s age at initial international market entry appears not to be a significant factor. The study adds to the very limited body of research on the marketing learning outcomes of international expansion, while also offering rare empirical insights from the Middle East on this important subject matter. The paper discusses implications for international managers, policy makers, and future researchers.
A New Species of Potamocoris (Heteroptera: Potamocoridae) from Belize, and Synonymy of the Genus Coleopterocoris	A new species of Potamocoridae, Potamocoris isbiru, is described from Belize. This taxon is easily recognized by the thick fringes of gold setae on the lateral margins of  the head, pronotum and basal hemelytra. This new species also exhibits both fully macropterous and coleopteriform wing morphologies, thereby encompassing the character states previously used to discriminate the genus Potamocoris Hungerford from the genus Coleopterocoris Hungerford. On the basis of this intraspecific wing  polymorphism, we conclude that Coleopterocoris is merely the coleopteriform morph of Potamocoris, and synonymize it under the latter genus. Figures of key morphological characters are provided for P. isbiru, accompanied by a photograph of typical habitat in which the species occurs, and a distribution map.
`Cloud` Will be Growth Driver in Developing Economies	Cloud computing has now become the fastest growing segment of the information communication technology (ICT) sector. The growth in global cloud computing traffic is forecast to increase twelve-fold between 2010 – 2015 (to $180b). Although most of this growth will take place in mature Western economies, there are also signs of positive trends unfolding in the developing world. In recent years, the developing economies have received considerable attention from global cloud computing players. For instance, IBM has established cloud computing centres in China, India, Vietnam and Brazil. Other cloud players such as Microsoft, VMware, Salesforce and Parallels have also been active in developing countries. Similarly, developing world cloud-based firms such as India’s CRL and AdventNet have jumped on the cloud bandwagon. Cloud related venture capital (VC) and other investments are also flowing into developing economies.
Structural Basis of SUFU–GLI Interaction in Human Hedgehog Signalling Regulation	Hedgehog signalling plays a fundamental role in the control of metazoan development, cell proliferation and differentiation, as highlighted by the fact that its deregulation is associated with the development of many human tumours. SUFU is an essential intracellular negative regulator of mammalian Hedgehog signalling and acts by binding and modulating the activity of GLI transcription factors. Despite its central importance, little is known about SUFU regulation and the nature of SUFU–GLI interaction. Here, the crystal and smallangle X-ray scattering structures of full-length human SUFU and its complex with the key SYGHL motif conserved in all GLIs are reported. It is demonstrated that GLI binding is associated with major conformational changes in SUFU,including an intrinsically disordered loop that is also crucial for pathway activation. These findings reveal the structure of the SUFU–GLI interface and suggest a mechanism for an essential regulatory step in Hedgehog signalling, offering possibilities for the development of novel pathway modulators and therapeutics.
The Development of Entrepreneurial Drive During the University Business School Experience	This research investigates changes in entrepreneurial drive (ED) between each of the three-year levels of  students at an undergraduate UK university business school in order to test this measurement construct  within a European context. The research adopted a quantitative approach to determine whether the ED  measurement instrument could identify differences in the students’ ED dimensions and the overall ED  across the three different years of undergraduate study. The data was subjected to principle component  analysis to create factor scores for the ED components and the multivariate analysis of variance tests to  determine whether different year groups exhibited different levels of ED.  The research found that the total ED score increased at each successive year level. In addition, the  achievement motivation, proactive disposition, and self-efficacy factors (dimensions) all increased during  the university experience. As such, this research confirms the value of the ED measurement instrument in  assessing the development of entrepreneurial drive within a European higher education setting.
Touching Annotations: A Visual Metaphor for Navigation of Annotation in Digital Documents.	Direct touch manipulation interactions with technology are now commonplace and significant interest is building around their use in the culture and heritage domain. Such interactions can give people the opportunity to explore materials and artefacts in ways that would otherwise be unavailable. These are often heavily annotated and can be linked to a large array of related digital content, thus enriching the experience for the user. Research has addressed issues of how to present digital documents and their related annotations but at present it is unclear what the optimal interaction approach to navigating these annotations in a touch display context might be.    In this paper we investigate the role of two alternative approaches to support the navigation of annotations in digitised documents in the context of a touch interface. Through a control study we demonstrate that, whilst the navigation paradigm displays a significant interaction with the type of annotations task performed, there is no discernible advantage of using a natural visual metaphor for annotation in this context. This suggests that design of digital document annotation navigation tools should account for the context and navigation tasks being considered.
Critical Practice Leadership in Post-compulsory Education	This article questions why leaders in post-compulsory education tend not to view leadership research positively or utilise it in improving their practice. Drawing on the theoretical literature of educational management and leadership, and the current political and economic context of post-compulsory education, it proposes a new direction of critical practice leadership informed by advanced practitioner research.  Challenging assumptions about leadership practice and leadership research creates opportunity for an ethical and practical perspective for leadership practitioners, and a distinctive contribution to the field of leadership theory and research by resisting the false dualism between theory and practice.
Understanding The Educational Workforce In Post-Compulsory Education: Introduction To The Special Issue.	Editorial introduction article to a special issue of Research in Post-Compulsory Education, on Understanding the Educational Workforce in Post-Compulsory Education.
Personal Exposure to Grass Pollen: Relating Inhaled Dose to Background Concentration	Background  Very few studies on human exposure to allergenic pollen have been conducted using direct methods, with background concentrations measured at city center monitoring stations typically taken as a proxy for exposure despite the inhomogeneous nature of atmospheric pollen concentrations. A 2003 World Health Organization report highlighted the need for an improved understanding of the relation between monitoring station data and actual exposure.    Objective  To investigate the relation between grass pollen dose and background concentrations measured at a monitoring station, to assess the fidelity of monitoring station data as a qualitative proxy for dose, and to evaluate the ratio of dose rate to background concentration.    Methods  Grass pollen dose data were collected in Aarhus, Denmark, in an area where grass pollen sources were prevalent, using Nasal Air Samplers. Sample collection lasted for approximately 25 to 30 minutes and was performed at 2-hour intervals from noon to midevening under moderate exercise by 2 individuals.    Results  A median ratio of dose rate to background concentration of 0.018 was recorded, with higher ratio values frequently occurring at 12 to 2 pm, the time of day when grass species likely to be present in the area are expected to flower. From 4 to 8 pm, dose rate and background concentration data were found to be strongly and significantly correlated (rs = 0.81). Averaged dose rate and background concentration data showed opposing temporal trends.    Conclusion  Where local emissions are not a factor, background concentration data constitute a good quantitative proxy for inhaled dose. The present ratio of dose rate to background concentration may aid the study of dose–response relations.
Ideology in Disguise: Place Name Metonyms and the Discourse of Newspaper Headlines	'Place metonyms' are figures of speech which use place names as shortcuts, for example Whitehall to mean the British civil service, or Europe for the institutions of the European Union. The paper examines place metonyms in the headlines of two British newspapers, the Sun and the Guardian. Using evidence from a 12-month period in 2011–12, a headline-by-headline linguistic analysis is used to work out the denotations and wider connotations of each metonym. This critical discourse approach suggests that such place metonyms in headlines have three problematic effects: firstly they may conceal agency and responsibility within some public bodies, secondly for some social institutions, they give an exaggerated impression of unity and homogeneity, and finally for a further list of institutions, they offer relentless pejorative evaluative colouring. These effects are found not only in the right-of-centre Sun but also to some extent in the more progressive newspaper, the Guardian. The authors speculate that it may be difficult for readers of newspapers to think critically about place metonyms in headlines. In particular, place metonyms may subtly reinforce any impression that public institutions are fixed entities, not susceptible to challenge, and may facilitate the polarised value-judgments that are characteristic of 'headlinese'. Such social constructions support some of the central tenets of neo-liberal, capitalist ideology, and so subtly add to the news media's distorting representations of public matters.
Celebrating the Social in Soccer: Spectators’ Experiences of the Forgotten (Blind) Football World Cup	Sporting spaces draw together distinct social assortments. Football (in various forms), for example, generates specific types of spectators and spectator behaviours. Cognizant of this work, our paper examines the 2010 World Blind Football Championships (WBFC) and its spectatorship. We conducted semi-structured interviews, orientated around perceptions of disability/disability sport, with 285 spectators. The thrust of our paper is that the event affords spectators opportunities to better understand, appreciate and engage with the experiences of athletes with a disability. We argue that the unique context of blind football competitions (characterized here as an unthreatening, convivial, often familial-like,  and somewhat parochial space) resulted in positive spectator experiences. We conclude that within the framework of bridging social capital, this unique  sporting space afforded the creation of relationships between the athletes (and the sport) and the spectators, two groups previously separated by social distance.
New Media Will Disrupt Global Advertising Industry	There is a revolution starting to unfold in the advertising industry where the rise of the Internet and a group of new media firms (such as Google, Facebook, Apple, Twitter and Amazon) are about to change the media and marketing landscapes. As traditional print and broadcast media moves onto a digital platform, the large Internet-based firms have acquired a natural monopoly of customer data. Not only are the Internet-based firms using this data to generate large advertising revenues but they are also taking over many of the traditional roles performed by full service advertising agencies such as media buying and selling using new technology based trading systems. This is changing the economics of advertising and causing disintermediation and disruption in an industry where the established business model hasn’t changed in over 50 years.
`M-Commerce` Will Transform Global Retail Industry	The recent spate of retail bankruptcies in the UK, Europe and North America has highlighted the increasing power and influence of large Internet companies such as Amazon. The shift towards online retail has been accelerated by the diffusion of mobile devices, such as smart phones and tablets, that provide consumers with instant access to information through the use of complementary technologies including augmented reality and location-based applications. This has led to the growth of `showrooming`, where shoppers view a product in a physical store but then buy online from an Internet retailer.
Ethical and Professional Concerns in Research Utilisation:    Intentional Rounding in the United Kingdom	Intentional rounding, a process involving the performance of regular checks on all patients following a standardised protocol, is being introduced widely in the United Kingdom. The process has been promoted by the Prime Minister and publicised by the Chief Nursing Officer at the Department of Health as well as by influential think tanks and individual National Health Service organisations. An evidence base is offered in justification. This article subjects the evidence base to critical scrutiny concluding that it consists of poor quality studies and serial misreporting of findings and a failure to consider wider concerns, including transference of evidence to differing health-care systems, and the conflation of perception and quality of care. Political promotion and wide implementation of intentional rounding despite the flimsy and questionable evidence base raise questions about the use of evidence in ethical nursing practice and the status of nursing as an autonomous profession.
`Platform` Model Will Change Global Corporate Strategy	The twenty first century has seen the emergence of a new platform business model where web-based companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook and Apple have been able to access multiple-markets and industries by exploiting the benefits of a platform ecosystem. These Internet-based corporations are able to leverage their technology platforms in order to enter industries that appear unrelated to their core businesses. This new rationale of how value is created, delivered and captured is in stark contrast to the business models practiced by established industrial firms and traditional bricks and mortar companies.
Computing is Becoming a Global `Utility Business`.	In the last twenty years the Internet has been the driver of significant transformational change. The first period of meteoric growth (Web 1.0) was characterised by the widespread adoption of Internet-enabled personal computers (PCs) and client server computing systems within the enterprise sector. The second period of disruptive change (Web 2.0) - which is currently unfolding (2005 – 2013) - was characterised by the shift in computing from networked PCs to mobile tablets and smart phone devices whose application and storage needs were supplied and supported externally by `cloud` based systems operated by large powerful Internet companies such as the `Gang of Four` (Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook). This period of rapid technological development also saw the enterprise sector marketing and operating cloud-based software services (SaaS) and hardware (HaaS) services.
A Mechanism For Long Distance Transport of Ambrosia Pollen From the Pannonian Plain	The pollen grains of ragweed are important aeroallergens that have the potential to be transported longdistances through the air. The arrival of ragweed pollen in Nordic countries from the Pannonian Plain canoccur when certain conditions are met, which this study aims to describe for the first time. Atmosphericragweed pollen concentrations were collected at 16 pollen-monitoring sites. Other factors included inthe analysis were the overall synoptic weather situation, surface wind speeds, wind direction and tem-peratures as well as examining regional scale orography and satellite observations. Hot and dry weatherin source areas on the Pannonian Plain aid the release of ragweed pollen during the flowering seasonand result in the deep Planetary Boundary Layers needed to lift the pollen over the Carpathian Moun-tains to the north. Suitable synoptic conditions are also required for the pollen bearing air masses tomove northward. These same conditions produce the jet-effect Kosava and orographic foehn winds thataid the release and dispersal of ragweed pollen and contribute towards its movement into Poland andbeyond.
Maximising Achievement and Progress in Secondary Physical Education Trainees. The Impact and Effectiveness of Using Ofsted Characteristics for Formative Diagnostic Assessment	In all areas of educational practice assessment is probably the most frequently debated. Frapwell (2010: 13) stated that ‘in the past twenty years no area in education has been as contentious, as newsworthy, possibly as time consuming or even as emotive as assessment.’ Maybe this is because apart from the teacher, it is assessment that has been shown to be the single most important component that influences student learning and education in general (Taras, 2008). Indeed, Broadfoot and Black (2004) discuss assessment as having ‘pervasive power’ which defines and shapes every aspect of educational life.  This article focuses upon a small-scale research study which aimed to maximise secondary physical education trainees’ achievement and progress over the course of their Post Graduate Certificate in Education (PGCE) year. It evaluated the impact and effectiveness of using Ofsted characteristics for formative diagnostic assessment, putting the trainees at the heart of their own assessment. The benefits of this approach to trainees will be discussed in relation to progress and performance, alongside ways of further developing this method of assessment to bring the highest quality of teaching and learning to the training of physical education teachers.
The Effect of Age of Acquisition on Older Individuals With and Without Cognitive Impairments	The present study compared the effects of age of acquisition (AoA) on object naming across groups of older individuals with cognitive impairments, healthy older controls, and young healthy controls. All participants named a set of 80 pictures, within which both AoA and frequency were manipulated orthogonally. Early-acquired objects were named faster than late-acquired objects across all groups. Response time also declined with age and with cognitive impairment between the groups. The effect of AoA differed across groups, with AoA effects being largest for the older group with cognitive impairments and smallest for the young control group. The present study adds strength to the suggestion that AoA of picture names is one of the factors that influence survival or loss of memories in dementia and cognitive decline, and this could therefore be used as a potential screening test for cognitive impairment disorders in the future.
‘The Beauty of a Sick Room’: Family Care for the Dying in the English Upper and Middle Class Home c.1840-c.1890	With the standard of care provided by hospitals and nursing homes to those nearing the end of their lives in Britain the subject of much concern and when increasing numbers of people would like to die at home, it is a timely moment to consider end of life care in the 19th century, when death at home was the norm and families had a leading role in providing care. This was also a period of change that laid the foundations for the 20th century model of hospital-centred palliative care. The article examines the experiences of middle and upper class carers, the objectives of care, including the importance of spiritual care, and the practicalities of providing care in the home. It also considers the support available to through informal networks of extended family, friends and neighbour and suggests aspects of care that may still have relevance to palliative care practice today.
Interpersonal Relationships in the Primary Classroom: an Analysis of Social and Affective Outcomes	Recent research regarding the quality of relationships in primary classrooms has focused largely on the enhancement and development of cognitive skills. The study reported here focused on a range of social and affective outcomes with the intention of broadening our understanding of the classroom as an interactive system, from the child's perspective. This paper provides empirical evidence on children's perceptions at Key Stage 2 (pupil age 7-11 years) of their relationships with teachers, other adults and children. Data were collected via an attitudinal questionnaire survey in nine primary schools in England. Results indicate that, in addition to the development of social skills, children also valued academic confidence, learning and the involvement of their parents in homework, and that these were associated with the interactions and routines established within the primary classroom settings. Some variations in terms of pupil age, teacher career phase, and the socio-economic context of the school were identified; however, the importance of the relationship between pupil and teacher remained consistent across schools.
Some May Beg to Differ: Individual Beliefs and Group Political Claims	While nurses can and do behave as intentional political agents, claims that nurses collectively do (empiric), should (normative) or must (regulatory) act to advance political objectives lack credibility. This paper challenges the coherence and legitimacy of political demands placed upon nurses. It is not suggested that nurses ought not to contribute to political discourse and activity. That would be foolish. However, the idea that nursing can own or exhibit a general political will is discarded. It is suggested that to protect and advance political discussion, to aid explanatory adequacy and clarity, the form in which nursing associates itself with political claims merits critical appraisal. Thus significant numbers of nurses probably reject or disagree with many of the political claims that attach to them – claims often made on their behalf. More specifically, the individual beliefs and goals of nurses can be in conflict with the political pronouncements of nursing scholars and organizations (group agents). It is proposed that nurses need not share substantive normative beliefs/goals and, if this proposal holds, group descriptors such as ‘nurses’ and ‘nursing’ cannot meaningfully or easily attach to political claims. Shared value theory is linked to the fallacy of composition and the concept of collective ascription error is introduced to explore the implausibility of using group descriptors such as ‘nurses’ and ‘nursing’ to refer to the beliefs/goals of all nurses.
Common Ragweed: A Threat to Environmental Health in Europe	Common or short ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is an annual herb belonging to the Asteraceae family that was described by Carl Linnaeus in the 18th century. It is a noxious invasive species that is an important weed in  agriculture and a source of highly allergenic pollen. The importance placed on A. artemisiifolia is reflected by the  number of international projects that have now been launched by the European Commission and the increasing  number of publications being produced on this topic. This review paper examines existing knowledge about ragweed ecology, distribution and flowering phenology and the environmental health risk that this noxious plant poses in Europe. The paper also examines control measures used in the fight against it and state of the art methods for modelling atmospheric concentrations of this important aeroallergen. Common ragweed is an environmental health threat, not only in its native North America but also in many parts of the world where it has been introduced. In Europe, where the plant has now become naturalised and frequently forms part of the flora, the threat posed by ragweed has been identified and steps are being taken to reduce further geographical expansion and limit increases in population densities of the plant in order to protect the allergic population. This is particularly important when one considers possible range shifts, changes in flowering phenology and increases in the amount of pollen and allergenic potency that could be brought about by  changes in climate.
The Influence of Sensitisation to Pollens and Moulds on Seasonal Variations in Asthma Attacks	No large study has described the seasonal variation in asthma attacks in population-based asthmatics in whom sensitisation to allergen has been measured.2637 young adults with asthma living in 15 countries reported the months in which they usually had attacks of asthma and had skin-prick tests performed. Differences in seasonal patterns by sensitisation status were assessed using generalised estimating equations.Most young adults with asthma reported periods of the year when their asthma attacks were more common (range: 47% in Sweden to 86% in Spain). Seasonal variation in asthma was not modified by sensitisation to house dust mite or cat allergens. Asthmatics sensitised to grass, birch and Alternaria allergens had different seasonal patterns to those not sensitised to each allergen, with some geographical variation. In southern Europe, those sensitised to grass allergens were more likely to report attacks occurred in spring or summer than in winter (OR March/April 2.60, 95% CI 1.70–3.97; OR May/June 4.43, 95% CI 2.34–8.39) and smaller later peaks were observed in northern Europe (OR May/June 1.25, 95% CI 0.60–2.64; OR July/August 1.66, 95% CI 0.89–3.10). Asthmatics reporting hay fever but who were not sensitised to grass showed no seasonal variations.Seasonal variations in asthma attacks in young adults are common and are different depending on sensitisation to outdoor, but not indoor, allergens.Seasonal variation in asthma attacks is associated with sensitisation to pollens and moulds, but not indoor allergens http://ow.ly/nsuRS
The Object Animates: Displacement and Humility in the Theatre of Philippe Quesne	This article considers the animating role that objects play in the theatre of Philippe Quesne and Vivarium Studio (France). The conventional role of object animation is often characterised by the performer manipulating objects and scenic material on the stage, asserting a control over the environment they are implicated in. In Quesne's theatre, this relationship is democratised. The theatrical apparatus, both materially and conceptually, is set up to enable the flow of animation to be interchangeable, affording an equal agency to the objects being used much as that of the performers. This theatre of animation is drawn through the framing concepts of displacement and humility. Displacement is considered as a compositional strategy that makes us aware of the volume of the stage space beyond the proscenium frame as a plane of composition. The introduction of large inflatable objects, real cars or large roles of fake snow foreground the objects material presence allows Quesne to play with moments of equilibrium, tipping, excess and absence. Humility is traced as a philosophy of objects that transcends the choice, handling and use of material items in Quesne's work. Simple objects take on a specific vibrancy because of how they give shape to the human participants on stage, animating moments of recognition that allows the human figure, its ethics, emotions and humour, to appear.
Creating Supportive Environments for Students	Appropriate clinical placements are an  essential part of pre-registration nurse  education. They provide students with the  opportunity to learn practical skills and  gain knowledge, so students’ learning is  heavily dependent on the quality of  support mentors provide.  At the end of each clinical placement,  student nurses are asked to evaluate the  experience. One recurring theme to  emerge from these evaluations is that  students often perceive mentors to be too  busy to provide the required level of  support. This can lead to increased levels  of anxiety for students as they may feel  unsupported. Mentors are one of the  critical factors affecting students’ ability to  learn and cope on their placements.  This article examines the current  situation and highlights how mentors can  enhance the clinical experience for students.
A DST-based Approach for Construction Project Risk Analysis	Despite its huge potential in risk analysis, the Dempster–Shafer Theory of Evidence (DST) has not received enough attention in construction management. This paper presents a DST-based approach for structuring personal experience and professional judgment when assessing construction project risk. DST was innovatively used to tackle the problem of lacking sufficient information through enabling analysts to provide incomplete assessments. Risk cost is used as a common scale for measuring risk impact on the various project objectives, and the Evidential Reasoning algorithm is suggested as a novel alternative for aggregating individual assessments. A spreadsheet-based decision support system (DSS) was devised to facilitate the proposed approach. Four case studies were conducted to examine the approach's viability. Senior managers in four British construction companies tried the DSS and gave very promising feedback. The paper concludes that the proposed methodology may contribute to bridging the gap between theory and practice of construction risk assessment.
The Experiences of Patients with Ascites Secondary to Cancer: a Qualitative Study	Background: Ascites secondary to cancer has a dramatic effect on all aspects of patients’ lives. Healthcare professional surveys have shown that there is considerable variation in the management of ascites.    Aim: To explore patients’ experiences of living with ascites and its management.    Design: Qualitative research study using digitally recorded semi-structured interviews.    Setting/participants: Twelve adult patients with ascites who, between them, had undergone 47 paracentesis procedures in hospitals and/or specialist palliative care units in Southern England.    Results: Symptoms were pain, discomfort and effects on appetite, digestion, breathing and mobility. All participants had experienced paracentesis in hospital or a specialist palliative care unit, and these experiences differed. They had views on what constituted a good procedure: setting, competence and pain control. They reported rapid improvement of symptoms after paracentesis. While some did not like the idea of a semi-permanent drain, those with them appreciated the convenience and not having to wait for repeated admissions or the recurrence of symptoms. The interval between ascitic taps was seen as a useful guide as to when a semi-permanent drain should be offered. Participants had mixed views on participation in a hypothetical randomised controlled trial of repeated ascitic taps versus semi-permanent drains.    Conclusion: Patients’ experiences of ascites management are variable and could be improved. These experiences can inform healthcare professionals. They have views on when semi-permanent drains should be offered and future research.

Challenging the Perceived Value of Alumni by Developing a Peer-Mentoring Scheme to Support Student Learning.	While peer-assisted learning and peer mentoring schemes are commonplace in HEIs, the use of alumni in supporting postgraduate students is a new and innovative development. This article describes a recent initiative at a post-92 university involving the use of alumni from the MBA programme to act as mentors for incoming part-time MBA students.
A “Body Unfitt”: Daniel Defoe in the Pillory and the Resurrection of the Versifying Self	This article explores Daniel Defoe’s poetic attempts at fashioning a new public literary identity for himself before and after his experience of the pillory in 1703. When his standing as a satirist and moral commentator came under attack as a consequence of publishing the controversial 'The Shortest Way with the Dissenters', Defoe used his poetry to counteract the disastrous consequences of his public punishment. This article suggests that, in order to recover his previously elevated position as the period’s leading verse satirist, Defoe tried to (re-)author an alternative, disembodied self. This process begins in 'A Hymn to the Pillory' (1703) with an imagined merging of Defoe’s own body with that of the pillory to produce a monstrous symbol of governmental corruption and continues in 'An Elegy on the Author of the True-Born Englishman' (1704) through the theme of compromised corporality and a metaphorical burial of the author’s tainted body. The process of Defoe’s authorial refashioning is then completed in the poem appended to 'An Elegy', ‘The Storm’, which describes the resurrection from its grave of an indignant but disembodied and therefore uncompromised versifying "walking Ghost" that, having withdrawn itself from the gaze of the authoring other, could resume the function of national moral guardian.
Stor variation i græspollen er en udfordring i vejledningen  til allergikere - resultater fra ny dansk pollenforskning    "Large variations in grass pollen concentrations are a challenge in the guidance of hayfever patients – new results from Danish research”	Pollenallergi rammer op mod en femtedel af Danmarks befolkning og forringer deres hverdag og livskvalitet. Et af de vigtigste værktøjer,en pollenallergiker har, er information om, hvornår der er pollen i luften. Denne information anvender allergikere til at planlægge indtag af medicin og tilrettelæggelse af hverdagen. Således kan de begrænse deres symptomer så meget som muligt. En primær kilde tilinformation er pollenmålinger fra Viborg og København. Ny forskning fra Aarhus Universitet (AU) og Astma Allergi Danmark afdækker, at der er væsentlige lokale forskelle I mængden af græspollen. Denne variation gælder især for dage med høje pollental. Resultaterne indikerer, at særligt på dage med høje pollental for græs er nærheden til locale kilder meget vigtig. På samme tid er de lokale  koncentrationer ikke nødvendigvis korreleret med pollenmålinger fra de nationale målestationer i Viborg og København.Information om døgnvariationen i pollen er vigtig for pollenallergikerne. De nye studier indikerer store forskelle fra dag til dag, I forhold til hvornår de højeste koncentrationer forekommer, og at dette billede ændrer sig  over pollensæsonen. Viden om døgnvariation, og hvad der styrer den, er endnu langt fra fyldestgørende i forhold til at kunne formidle denne information til pollenallergikere. Vores studier peger i retning af, at de højeste koncentrationer af græspollen hyppigst forekommer  tidligt på aftenen, men at de kan forekomme på alle tider af døgnet.
Minority Question in the Nigerian Governmental Process	Given  the  monumental  friction,  tension  and  acrimony  occasioned by minority question in Nigeria’s governmental process, the paper is aimed at encapsulating the dynamics of minority question as it affects/impact the governmental process of Nigeria. It argues that minority question in Nigeria, just like other parts of the developed world, including Australia for example, reinforces itself in the culture and pervasive nature of ethnicity, defined in terms of group interest, sectional polarization, self-esteem and identification. Findings revealed that, Ethnicity is therefore considered as the epicenter of minority agitations as each of these groups struggle not in the nation’s interest, but in the interest of identifiable groups and regional hegemony for recognition and control oil resources. The paper concludes that the minority question cannot be divorce from governmental processes, because it has become a part of socio-political fabric of the Nigerian state, hence, the need for a virile federal structure that recognizes and responds positively to the interest of the minor groups is essential. The paper is a survey of literatures from existing works of scholars, generated to enhance the understanding of the subject matter  under  review; as  such the methodology is strictly based on content secondary data.
Glaciation style and the Geomorphological Record: Evidence for Younger Dryas Glaciers in the Eastern Lake District, Northwest England	The Younger Dryas (c. 12,900–11,700 years ago) in Britain witnessed renewed glaciation, with the readvance of ice masses that had survived the preceding Lateglacial Interstadial as well as the formation of new glaciers. The extents of these former glaciers have been mapped by many workers over the past fifty years, usually as a basis for palaeoclimatic investigations. It has frequently been asserted that the landform record is sufficiently clear to allow accurate ice mass reconstructions at or near maximum extents. Detailed geomorphological mapping in the eastern Lake District in NW England, however, demonstrates that this confidence may not always be warranted. Whereas previous workers have interpreted the well-developed moraines that exist in some locations as evidence for an alpine-style of glaciation, with ice restricted to a small number of valleys, this study shows that the most recent glaciation to affect the area was characterised by: (i) extensive summit icefields, which supplied ice to the surrounding valleys; and (ii) a much greater volume of ice in the valleys than previously thought. The discovery that summit icefields were relatively common at this time is consistent with recent studies elsewhere in the Lake District and beyond. More significant, however, is the recognition that changing glacier–topographic interactions over both space and time appears to have had a profound impact on valley-floor glacial landform development, with the absence of clear moraines not necessarily indicating ice-free conditions at this time. This complicates glacier reconstructions based solely on the geomorphological record. Similar geomorphological complexity may be present in other areas that previously supported summit icefields, and this needs to be taken into account in glacier reconstructions.
Analysis and Forecasting of Airborne Pollen-induced Symptoms with the Aid of Computational Intelligence Methods	Allergies due to airborne pollen affect a considerable percentage of Europeans; thus, the provision of health-related information services concerning pollen-induced symptoms can improve the overall quality of life. In this paper, we demonstrate the development of personalized, health-related, quality-of-life information services by adopting a data-driven approach. The data we use consist of allergic symptoms reported by people as well as detailed pollen count information of the most allergenic taxa. We apply computational intelligence methods in order to analyze symptoms, identify possible interrelationships with several pollen taxa and develop models that associate pollen count levels with allergic symptoms on a personal level. The results for the case of Austria show that this approach can lead to accurate personalized symptom forecasting models; we report an average correlation coefficient of rÂ =Â 0.70 for a sample of 102 users of the Patients Hayfever Diary. We conclude that some of these models could serve as the basis for personalized health information services.
Laying Down the Foundations for International Student Journey. Students as Academic Partners Project Report.	The aim of this project was to explore the lived experiences of being an international student studying at a University within the UK and to make recommendations for future provision. There are increasing numbers of international students studying at Universities within the UK. Positive learning environments and arrangements are the responsibility of the host University and international students’ needs should be taken into consideration. This project was led by international students in collaboration with academic staff. It involved a qualitative exploration of international student perspectives and their experiences of studying within the UK. Ten international students completed a questionnaire that was designed by international students. Respondents were asked questions in relation to three areas: coming to the UK, arriving in the UK and studying in the UK.
Empirical study of cyber harassment among social networks	The growth of Online Social Networking sites has brought new services and communication methods to consumers. However, along with benefits, serious problems such as online cyber harassment have recently come to the forefront of the electronic media. This behavior can have significant negative effect on individuals, businesses and the social networks. Some sites have begun to provide some levels of protection and create specific anti-harassment policies in their terms of service along with implementing protection technologies. However, these protective measures are not consistent among social media, leaving some consumers at greater risk. This study analyzed 60 worldwide social sites and determined the level of cyber-harassment protection. It reviewed statistical differences among geographical-based social networks. The results showed significant gaps among various social networks, but suggests methods for improving consumer safeguards to provide consistent levels of protection.
Using USB Devices for Online Document Storage in Worcester Business School	The Worcester Business School (WBS) is migrating from paper-based assignment submission to electronic submission and feedback. Currently, no policies or procedures exist for staff and tutors to effectively manage the administration document storage for this process, thus creating confusion and lack of effectiveness among stakeholders. This project report suggests a method for managing the administration portion of the e-submission/feedback procedure using USB devices for online storage.
Academic Plate Spinning: the Difficulties of Balancing Full Time Degree Study With a Part-Time Job	The study examined full-time students engaged in part-time work during term time. A qualitative approach was used to examine how students cope with simultaneously managing the two activities, and how part-time working affects their academic study. Semi-structured interviews were used to obtain data from a sample of 30 undergraduate business students. The findings confirm that students merely satisfice many aspects of their lives, with reading time and assignment preparation being key areas that suffer in order to allow students to engage with part-time work. Possible options available to HEIs to adapt to, and remedy, the situation are explored.
Institute of Sport and Exercise Science Students’ Perception of Library Resources and Their Availability	While students appear to find library resources difficult to understand and use, they also seem reluctant to ask for help or unwilling to persevere when searching does not yield instant results. Focusing on undergraduate students studying Sport and Exercise Science, this paper discusses the findings of focus group interviews conducted with each undergraduate year group. The students were asked about their expectations of the library service and how they had acquired the information skills needed to use library resources. Students struggled to articulate individual skills required for successful library searches and frequently identified library instruction with boredom and frustration. The findings indicate that students expect using library resources to be easy, find librarian-led library teaching to be unrealistic, and develop a strategic searching strategy whereby as little time is spent on researching as possible. While primarily the views of ISES students, the findings could be applied to the wider student body. The paper recommends further investigation into students’ strategic searching and how this relates to their information literacy needs.
The Use of Touch Screen Technology by People with Dementia and Their Carers in Care Home Settings.	Dominic Upton, Jennifer Bray, Tim Jones and Penney Upton report on research that confirms that touchscreen devices can be of great benefit in engaging and supporting people with dementia.
The acute effect of whole-body vibration on cycling peak power output	The aim of the present study was to determine if an acute bout of whole-body vibration (WBV) prior to sprint cycling would increase peak power output. Ten male cyclists, all familiar with maximal sprint cycling exercise performed, on two separate occasions, a ten second standing sprint on a cycle ergometer. For one trial the sprint was preceded by a 2 minute WBV intervention, requiring the participant to stand on a vibrating platform that produced sinusoidal oscillations. The frequency and amplitude of the vibration was set at 26Hz and ‘high’ (approximately 2mm) respectively. For the other trial participants stood in the same position, however the platform did not vibrate (no-WBV; 0Hz and 0mm for frequency and amplitude respectively). No significant difference was recorded for peak power output between trials (1458.0 + 283.7 W versus 1506.3 + 232.5 W for WBV and no-WBV respectively, P = 0.17). The results suggest that WBV prior to maximal standing sprint cycling does not increase peak power output.
Global Internet Firms Disrupt Business Beyond the Web	Apple, Amazon, Google and Facebook – referred to in technology circles as the `gang of four` - are having a dramatic impact on the established business models of a range of industries and markets. A new form of competitive advantage is now emerging which is grounded primarily in access to huge amounts of useful data. `Gang of four` members, which collectively boast a market capitalisation of nearly 1 trillion dollars, possess enormous amounts of information. Since information is the lifeblood of most organisations, particularly modern service companies, this has resulted in huge market power for these four internet-based companies.
Badiou's Spectator-Subject and Fireworks Politics	This article examines the political nature of fireworks as a paradigm for the relation between theatre and politics. It follows the firework trope from the work of Stéphane Mallarmé to that of Alain Badiou and suggests the symbolist poet’s quest for a mysterious collective leads to the philosopher’s attempt to materially account for the necessary inexistance of emancipatory movements against or away from State, party, class or label. While for Mallarmé, the collective is the vanishing term for art, for Badiou, it is the vanishing term for politics. This article examines how, following the ephemeral May 1871 or May 1968 events, both thinkers deplore the absence of emancipatory movements and turn to theatre to think the collective as theatre provides them with an allegory similar to that of the fireworks to suggest that the political potential of the crowd resides in its ability to disperse and resist being labelled. Building upon these two allegories, this article investigates how spectators can become points of reference to map out a present of politics and how Badiou’s notion of ‘body’ and ‘trace’ developed in Logics of Worlds can be used to reactivate the political nature of Badiou’s theory of theatre.
Openly Lesbian Team Sport Athletes in an Era of Decreasing Homohysteria.	Sociologists who examine the issue of lesbians in American sport in the 1980s and 1990s normally found overt and covert mechanisms of social discrimination. However, homophobia has been on a rapid decline over previous decades, and studies show attitudes toward female homosexuality in sport have improved since the research conducted on lesbian athletes in the mid-1990s. This article uses data collected between that epoch and current studies to analyze athletic narratives of openly lesbian team sport athletes in 2002. We find no universal pattern for the treatment of openly lesbian athletes existed in this era of decreasing homohysteria. However, as with gay men in sport at the time, athletic capital influenced who came out, and heterosexism was prominent.
Wasta in the Jordanian Culture: a Study in the Banking Sector	Due to globalisation, the emergence and expansion of new overseas markets, extensive use of information and communication technologies in global trade and growing competition between multinational companies, international Human Resource Management (HRM) is an increasingly attractive and popular area of study. However, much of our knowledge is built on an Anglo-Saxon/ European base and there is a paucity of research that considers the transfer of modern (western) principles of HRM to developing countries, particularly in the Middle East. Arguably, Jordan is one country that may benefit from the promise of quality, equality and profitability offered by the systemic approach to managing people. Thus, this paper introduces a PhD research project, currently in its first year, that considers the transfer of western recruitment and selection frameworks into Jordanian culture.
Airborne Olive Pollen Counts are not Representative of  1 Exposure to the Major Olive Allergen Ole e 1	Pollen is routinely monitored, but it is unknown whether pollen counts represent allergen exposure. We therefore simultaneously determined olive pollen and Ole e 1 in ambient air in C"ordoba, Spain, and "Evora, Portugal, using Hirst-type traps for pollen and high-volume cascade impactors for allergen. Pollen from different days released 12-fold different amounts of Ole e 1 per pollen (both locations P < 0.001). Average allergen release from pollen (pollen potency) was much higher in C"ordoba (3.9 pg Ole e 1/pollen) than in "Evora (0.8 pg Ole e 1/pollen, P = 0.004). Indeed, yearly olive pollen counts in C"ordoba were 2.4 times higher than in "Evora, but Ole e 1 concentrations were 7.6 times higher. When modeling the origin of the pollen, >40% of Ole e 1 exposure in "Evora was explained by high-potency pollen originating from the south of Spain. Thus, olive pollen can vary substantially in allergen release, even though they are morphologically identical.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids are Related to Abnormal Emotion Processing in Adolescent Boys with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder	Background    In addition to the core symptoms, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is associated with poor emotion regulation. There is some evidence that children and young adults with ADHD have lower omega-3 levels and that supplementation with omega-3 can improve both ADHD and affective symptoms. We therefore investigated differences between ADHD and non-ADHD children in omega-3/6 fatty acid plasma levels and the relationship between those indices and emotion-elicited event-related potentials (ERPs).    Methods    Children/adolescents with (n=31) and without ADHD (n=32) were compared in their plasma omega-3/6 indices and corresponding ERPs during an emotion processing task.    Results    Children with ADHD had lower mean omega-3/6 and ERP abnormalities in emotion processing, independent of emotional valence relative to control children. ERP abnormalities were significantly associated with lower omega-3 levels in the ADHD group.    Conclusions    The findings reveal for the first time that lower omega-3 fatty acids are associated with impaired emotion processing in ADHD children.
Omega-3 Fatty Acids are Inversely Related to Callous and Unemotional Traits in Adolescent Boys with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder	A number of research studies have reported abnormal plasma fatty acid profiles in children with ADHD along with some benefit of n−3 to symptoms of ADHD. However, it is currently unclear whether (lower) long chain-polyunsaturated fatty acids (LC-PUFAs) are related to ADHD pathology or to associated behaviours. The aim of this study was to test whether (1) ADHD children have abnormal plasma LC-PUFA levels and (2) ADHD symptoms and associated behaviours are correlated with LC-PUFA levels. Seventy-two, male children with (n=29) and without a clinical diagnosis of ADHD (n=43) were compared in their plasma levels of LC-PUFA. Plasma DHA was higher in the control group prior to statistical correction. Callous–unemotional (CU) traits were found to be significantly negatively related to both eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and total omega-3 in the ADHD group. The findings unveil for the first time that CU and anti-social traits in ADHD are associated with lower omega-3 levels.
Team Identification Reduces Social Loafing and Promotes Social Laboring in Cycling	The purpose was to examine if heightened team identification reduced social loafing and promoted  social laboring in 1 and 3 minute cycling time-trials with participants alone and then in either salient or  non-salient teams. Salient teams were created using 30 minutes of team building activities prior to their  team time trials. Social loafing occurred in both team trials in the non-salient teams (P < .05). In the  salient teams, social loafing was eliminated in the 1 minute team trial and social laboring was apparent  in the 3 minute team trial (P < .05). Heightened team identification therefore reduced social loafing and  significantly enhanced team performance.
Is the role of paramedic lecturer practitioner fit for purpose?	Lecturer practitioners have been in existence in nursing since the late 1980s (Elcock 1998, Ramage 2004). Since then the role has been developed and refined, but the overarching concept has remained the same: that is to support students and staff in their workplace (Redwood et al 2002). Paramedic education has moved into the higher education arena and with it comes the responsibilities of supervising and managing students in clinical practice. The lecturer practitioner role is currently one of the ways in which this issue is tackled.  Within this literature review the role of the lecturer practitioner in the wider health care context is considered followed by an examination of the successes and problems encountered in the role. An evaluation of future strategies to improve the role then ensues followed by a discussion section that relates the identified literature to paramedic practice. The overall conclusion is that the lecturer practitioner role is suitable for paramedic practice but some adjustments should be made to the nursing model in order to accommodate the peculiarities of paramedic practice.
Problematizing The Dominant: The Emergence Of Alternative Cultural Voices In Fiji Rugby	Today's indigenous Fijian culture is often said to be represented by ratuism, religion and rugby. Rugby is widely described as Fiji's ‘national’ sport, with a considerable degree of social significance. That rugby is listed alongside two powerful institutions (ratuism and religion) in the life of indigenous Fijians is a clear indication of the central cultural importance of the sport. In this paper, drawing upon the existing literature as well as our own research data, we outline the key aspects of the dominant rugby discourse in relation to ratuism and religion, along with exploring some of rugby's main alternative cultural ‘functions’. Employing a cultural studies approach, our main goal is to interpret and (re)present some of the chief alternative discourses in Fiji rugby and to discuss their role in the formation of dominant and emergent cultural practices.
Perturbations in Blood Phosphatidylcholine and Sphingomyelin Fatty Acid Composition in a Sample Population of Cigarette Smokers	Docosahexaenoic (DHA) and arachidonic acids (AA) are polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), major components of brain tissue and neural systems, and the precursors of a number of biologically active metabolites with functions in inflammation resolution, neuroprotection and other actions. As PUFAs are highly susceptible to peroxidation, we hypothesised whether cigarette smokers would present altered PUFAs levels in plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids. Adult males from Indian, Sri-Lankan or Bangladeshi genetic backgrounds who reported smoking between 20 and 60 cigarettes per week were recruited. The control group consisted of matched non-smokers. A blood sample was taken, plasma and erythrocyte total lipids were extracted, phospholipids were separated by thin layer chromatography, and the fatty acid content analysed by gas chromatography. In smokers, dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid, the AA precursor, was significantly reduced in plasma and erythrocyte phosphatidylcholine. AA and DHA were significantly reduced in erythrocyte sphingomyelin. Relatively short term smoking has affected the fatty acid composition of plasma and erythrocyte phospholipids with functions in neural tissue composition, cell signalling, cell growth, intracellular trafficking, neuroprotection and inflammation, in a relatively young population. As lipid peroxidation is pivotal in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer disease, early effects of smoking may be relevant for the development of such conditions.
A Systematic Review of Methods For Assessing Competence in Cognitive–behavioural Therapy.	Effective assessment of Cognitive Behaviour Therapy (CBT) competence is crucial to the success of the current drive to expand CBT training and service provision, and to the widespread dissemination of CBT into routine practice. However, a lack of consensus about how CBT competence should be assessed has resulted in the use of numerous different methods, many of which have been widely criticised. This review describes and eval-uates the various methods of assessing CBT competence. A systematic literature search identiﬁed 64 articles pertaining to a method of assessing competence in the provision of standard CBT interventions to adults experiencing mental health problems. Ten methods for assessing CBT therapist competence were identiﬁed from these articles and are presented within Miller's (Miller, G. E. [1990]. The assessment of clinical skills/ competence/performance. Academic Medicine, 65, 63–67) framework for assessing clinical skill. The advantages and disadvantages of each method are examined in relation to reliability, validity and feasibility. The limitations of the current evidence base are outlined and priorities for future research are highlighted. Tentative recommendations for assessing therapist competence are made within the context of the limited evidence base and need for feasibility in clinical practice settings.
Plant WEE1 Kinase is Cell Cycle Regulated and Removed at Mitosis via the 26S Proteasome Machinery.	In yeasts and animals, premature entry into mitosis is prevented by the inhibitory phosphorylation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) by WEE1 kinase, and, at mitosis, WEE1 protein is removed through the action of the 26S proteasome. Although in higher plants WEE1 function has been confirmed in the DNA replication checkpoint, Arabidopsis wee1 insertion mutants grow normally, and a role for the protein in the G2/M transition during an unperturbed plant cell cycle is yet to be confirmed. Here data are presented showing that the inhibitory effect of WEE1 on CDK activity in tobacco BY-2 cell cultures is cell cycle regulated independently of the DNA replication checkpoint: it is high during S-phase but drops as cells traverse G2 and enter mitosis. To investigate this mechanism further, a yeast two-hybrid screen was undertaken to identify proteins interacting with Arabidopsis WEE1. Three F-box proteins and a subunit of the proteasome complex were identified, and bimolecular fluorescence complementation confirmed an interaction between AtWEE1 and the F-box protein SKP1 INTERACTING PARTNER 1 (SKIP1). Furthermore, the AtWEE1–green fluorescent protein (GFP) signal in Arabidopsis primary roots treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 was significantly increased compared with mock-treated controls. Expression of AtWEE1–YFPC (C-terminal portion of yellow fluorescent protein) or AtWEE1 per se in tobacco BY-2 cells resulted in a premature increase in the mitotic index compared with controls, whereas co-expression of AtSKIP1–YFPN negated this effect. These data support a role for WEE1 in a normal plant cell cycle and its removal at mitosis via the 26S proteasome.
The Causal Impact of Resistance: Mediating Between Resistance and Internal Conversation About Resistance.	Current literature on resistance focuses on the elements of action and opposition as its main components. However, when we use the term resistance we are not necessarily referring exclusively to the active expression of opposition, but could also be referring to discussions about such events or to stimuli that may cause these acts. Thus resistance, for the purposes of this study, is perceived in terms of action, external conversation and stimuli, and it is argued that these external characteristics may be further processed through deliberation and internal conversations about resistance. An exploratory empirical study revealed inner aspects of resistance, and examined whether internal conversations about resistance could actually be experienced by agents. This article further supports the argument that, as individuals produce internal conversations about resistance, they may end by following one of the suggested options: they may keep their internal conversations unspoken, or produce a course of action related to resistance (and identified as such), or they may produce external conversations about resistance, or they may end by producing resistance that is not recognisable (to others) as such. In all these cases, internal conversations about resistance are involved and it is therefore argued that the causal impact of resistance may derive from agential processes and powers as well as from action, stimuli or external conversations related to resistance.
Challenges and Strategies for Teachers and Learners of English as a Second Language: the Case of an Urban Primary School in Kenya	With over 40 spoken tongues in Kenya, English serves as a language of instruction in schools and is taught from  the onset of schooling, making the language a significant factor in academic achievement and subsequent social  mobility. This article draws on a case study conducted in an urban multilingual primary school in Kenya and focuses on the challenges and strategies for teaching and learning English as a second language (ESL) in primary schools. The findings are based on evidence gathered from teachers, through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews, and from pupils, through learner diaries. The data show a strategic approach to teaching and learning English and reveal the tremendous effort invested by teachers and learners in grappling with the challenges of learning English in the context of an unresolved national language policy, interference from regional linguistic heritage languages and an examination-oriented education system. The strategies deployed by teachers to address these challenges include varied instructional approaches and creating a warm classroom climate to provide a non-threatening environment for learning and language acquisition. Data from pupils shows that group based interactions with their peers and individual reinforcement strategies, such as keeping vocabulary notebooks, are the most common learner strategies. The study shows how school-based research can give teachers and learners a voice in the development of successful language teaching and learning strategies for complex and challenging multilingual environments.
Making Care Homes Part of the Community?  An Evaluation of the Gloucestershire  Partnerships for Older People Project	Purpose – This paper report on the evaluation of a project that aimed to improve the integration of care  homes with health and social care services and with the wider community.  Design/methodology/approach – The evaluation adopted a mixed methods approach, combining  quantitative performance data with semi-structured stakeholder interviews and emergency bed use  costings.  Findings – The evaluation suggests that the project made significant steps towards integrating care  homes with the health and social care community and demonstrated cost savings through reduced  hospital bed use.  Practical implications – Health and social care interventions aimed at upskilling care home staff can  increase standards of care and quality of life for residents; they are also likely to highlight unmet needs.  Originality/value – The project demonstrated the need for better integration of health and social care  services with care homes in order to improve quality of life for residents.

Suicide and Language: Why we Shouldn't Use the 'C' Word.	Suicide is not a sin and is no longer a crime, so we should  stop saying that people ‘commit’ suicide. We now live in a  time when we seek to understand people who experience  suicidal ideation, behaviours and attempts, and to treat them with compassion rather than condemn them. Part of this is to use appropriate, non-stigmatising terminology when referring to suicide.
An Assessment of Variants in the Professional Judgement of  Geomorphologically-based Channel Types.	River classification is a useful tool for researchers and managers wishing to organise, simplify and understand the forms and processes within freshwater systems. Many classifications require surveyors to classify reaches into specific channel types in a field environment. Channel types should be identifiable based on a field surveyor’s  judgement of channel characteristics and landscape settings; these include channel planform, valley confinement, dominant bed material, and/or instream geomorphic features (e.g. gravel bars). Accurate classification of reaches into the correct channel  type is important to ensure consistency in management strategies, and to assess the impact of engineering activities on the physical and ecological status of rivers. In this paper, we examine the variation in professional judgement of geomorphologically based channel types by scientists with different disciplinary backgrounds, and varying levels of involvement in classification systems using a photo-questionnaire. Results indicate that there can be a large level of discrepancy in typing rivers; the choice of the modal channel type for each reach varied between 25.9% and 75.1% of the respondent selections. There were also differences in the level of agreement between  earth scientists (with hydrogeomorphological or geological training), ecological scientists (with freshwater biology training) and practitioners involved in river conservation and management. A high level of experience in classification systems translates to a lower number of channel types being chosen per reach. In response to these results, the use of a photographic approach to typing needs to be fully tested and users fully trained before operational use. Furthermore, we advocate that designers of  geomorphic typologies should aim to have a representative and workable number of classes within a typology with an emphasis for rationalisation of classes rather than expansion of numbers.
History, National Identity and the Environment in Contemporary English Fiction for Children	A discussion of history, national identity and the environment in contemporary English fiction for children and the pattern emergent in the fiction of contemporary English writers for children as a continuation of the emphasis on history but reflecting different concerns relevant to today’s society, culture and construction of childhood.
Identifying Urban Sources as Cause of Elevated Grass Pollen Concentrations using GIS and Remote Sensing	We examine here the hypothesis that during flowering, the grass pollen concentrations at a specific site reflect the distribution of grass pollen sources within a few kilometres of this site.We perform this analysis on data from a measurement campaign in the city of Aarhus (Denmark) using three pollen traps and by comparing these observations with a novel inventory of grass pollen sources. The source inventory is based on a new methodology developed for urbanscale grass pollen sources. The new methodology is believed to be generally applicable for the European area, as it relies on commonly available remote sensing data combined with management information for local grass areas. The inventory has identified a number of grass pollen source areas present within the city domain. The comparison of the measured pollen concentrations with the inventory shows that the atmospheric concentrations of grass pollen in the urban zone reflect the source areas identified in the inventory, and that the pollen sources that are found to affect the pollen levels are located near or within the city domain. The results also show that during days with peak levels of pollen concentrations there is no correlation between the three urban traps and an operational trap located just 60 km away. This finding suggests that during intense flowering, the grass pollen concentration mirrors the local source distribution and is thus a local-scale phenomenon. Model simulations aimed at assessing population exposure to pollen levels are therefore recommended to take into account both local sources and local atmospheric transport, and not to rely only on describing regional to long-range transport of pollen. The derived pollen source inventory can be entered into local-scale atmospheric transport models in combination with other components that simulate pollen release in order to calculate urban-scale variations in the grass pollen load. The gridded inventory with a resolution of 14m is therefore made available as supplementary material to this paper, and the verifying grass pollen observations are additionally available in tabular form.
The Economic Impact of Early Intervention in Psychosis Services for Children and Adolescents	Aims: To develop and populate a plausible model of the impact of early intervention (EI) for children and adolescents with psychosis to estimate potential short-term health-related cost savings compared to generic Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS). Method: A decision-tree-based model for EI in CAMHS was developed. The model was populated using data relating to the use of inpatient care and EI service activity for people aged under 18 from an area of North East England. Data were abstracted from the National Health Service clinical reporting systems for 2001-2008. Sensitivity analyses were performed to examine costs associated with the model under differing assumptions. Results: EI delivered cost savings of £4814 per patient compared to care provided by generic CAMHS. Cost savings were predominantly a consequence of reduced length of hospital admissions for patients served by the EI team. The findings were robust to sensitivity analyses. Conclusions: These findings suggest that EI services for children and adolescents with psychosis provide potential direct health cost savings comparable to those observed for working-age adults.
Development and Validation of the Career Competencies Indicators (CCI)	This paper describes the development and validation of the Career Competencies Indicator (CCI); a 43-item measure to assess career competencies. Following an extensive literature review, a comprehensive item generation process involving consultation with subject matter experts, a pilot study and a factor analytic study on a large sample yielded a seven factor structure; goal setting and career planning, self-knowledge, job-performance, career-related skills, knowledge of (office) politics, career guidance and networking, and feedback seeking and self-presentation. Coefficient alpha reliabilities of the seven dimensions ranged from .93 to .81. Convergent validity was established by showing below chance similarity between CCI sub-scales, and discrminant validity between the CCI sub-scales and the big five personality scales. The results also suggested criterion-related validity of the CCI, since career competencies were found to jointly predict objective and subjective career success.
Roles of Performance and Human Capital in College Football Coaches' Compensation.	Despite the escalation of football coaches' salaries at National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) institutions, little empirical investigation has been undertaken to identify the determinants of their compensation. As such, the purpose of this study is to explain how the level of coaching compensation is determined based on three theoretical perspectives in managerial compensation: marginal productivity theory, human capital theory, and managerialism. The analysis of compensation data of head foot-ball coaches at FBS institutions in 2006-2007 shows that the maximum total compensation of these coaches increases with their past performance. The results further reveal that coaches with greater human capital tend to receive a compensation package where bonuses account for a smaller proportion of the maximum total compensation. Overall, these findings mostly confirm the predictions drawn from managerial productivity theory, human capital theory and managerialism.
Predicting Drive for Muscularity Behavioral Engagement from Body Image Attitudes and Emotions.	We examined the potential moderating effects of appearance investment, body image disturbance, and situational body image dysphoria on the drive for muscularity attitudebehavior relationship. Participants (339 British college men, MAGE = 20.00 years, SD = 2.59)  completed drive for muscularity attitude and behavior, appearance investment, body image disturbance, and situational body image dysphoria measures. Results indicated higher levels of appearance investment, body image disturbance, and situational body image dysphoria  were associated with increases in the drive for muscularity attitude’s relationship with physique-enhancing behavioral engagement. Results help extend recent research that has  moved beyond identifying correlates to examining ways that groups of variables interact to predict drive for muscularity behavioral engagement and may contribute to theory development.
A Proteomic Approach Provides New Insights into the Control of Soil-borne Plant Pathogens by Bacillus Species	Beneficial microorganisms (also known as biopesticides) are considered to be one of the most promising methods for more rational and safe crop management practices. We used Bacillus strains EU07, QST713 and FZB24, and investigated their inhibitory effect on Fusarium. Bacterial cell cultures, cell-free supernatants and volatiles displayed varying degrees of suppressive effect. Proteomic analysis of secreted proteins from EU07 and FZB24 revealed the presence of lytic enzymes, cellulases, proteases, 1,4-β-glucanase and hydrolases, all of which contribute to degradation of the pathogen cell wall. Further proteomic investigations showed that proteins involved in metabolism, protein folding, protein degradation, translation, recognition and signal transduction cascade play an important role in the control of Fusarium oxysporum. Our findings provide new knowledge on the mechanism of action of Bacillus species and insight into biocontrol mechanisms.
Using a Simple, Free Voice-over-Internet Protocol Service to Add Interest to Lectures and Enhance Student Engagement	A large proportion of students in higher education report feeling bored during lectures, for example, Mann and Robinson (2009) put this figure at 60 per cent. This short article reviews our experiences using a simple, free Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP) service, Skype, to enhance the interest and engagement of students by holding a synchronous, online discussion with a remotely-located expert in a field of great interest to those students. While a formal evaluation has not been conducted, technology and process options are described and indications that the students found the combination engaging are included. A formal evaluation in the future could reveal whether these observations are replicated.
Bakhtinian Pedagogy:  Opportunities and Challenges for Research, Policy and Practice in Education Across the Globe (Book Review)	After an introductory chapter come twelve chapters, multi-authored, divided into three sections: Pedagogy as Authorship, emphasising the pupils/students as authors of their new understanding; Pedagogy as Answerability, emphasising the exchange of ideas through dialogue; and Pedagogy as Chronotope, emphasising real/fictional time-place relationships. The chapters will be described in the second half of this review. It is a useful book, which I recommend.
Novel Management to Enhance Spider Biodiversity in Existing Grass Buffer Strips	Grass buffer strips have been widely sown to mitigate against intensive agricultural management practices that have negatively impacted on invertebrate and plant biodiversity in arable farming systems. Typically, such strips are floristically species poor and are dominated by grasses. In the present study, we developed management practices to enhance the floristic and structural diversity of these existing strips for the benefit of spiders, a key provider of natural pest control in crops.      Across three UK arable farms, we investigated the benefits of: (i) scarification to create germination niches into which wildflower seeds were sown and (ii) the effect of graminicide applications to suppress grass dominance. Spiders were sampled twice per year (July and September) during 2008 and 2009.      The combination of scarification with wildflower seeds, as well as graminicide, resulted in the greatest wildflower cover and lowest grass cover, with a general trend of increased abundance of adult and juvenile spiders. The abundance of Pachygnatha degeeri, Bathyphantes gracilis and juvenile wolf spiders of the genus Pardosa was positively correlated with wildflower cover, probably reflecting increased prey availability. Sward structure was negatively correlated with Erigone atra, Oedothorax fuscus and juvenile Pardosa abundance.      Management that utilizes existing commonly adopted agri-environment options, such as grass buffer strips, represents a potentially important conservation tool for increasing the quantity and quality of invertebrate habitats. This can maximize opportunities for the provision of multiple ecosystem services, including pest regulation by predators such as spiders. These management practices have the potential to be incorporated into existing U.K. and European agri-environment schemes.
Exercise Performance and Neuromuscular Activity at a Fixed Level of RPE Following Manipulation of Peripheral Physiological Status.	PURPOSE: to analyse the effect of manipulation of peripheral physiological status on performance and neuromuscular activity during cycling at a fixed level of RPE. METHODS: following familiarisation trials, seven well trained individuals completed two exercise trials following ingestion of 0.2g.kg-1 NaHCO3 or a CaCO3 placebo which were performed in a randomised and blind manner. During exercise participants were required to cycle at exercise intensity equivalent to their perception of an RPE of 16 on the Category Ratio Scale. Blood pH was measured pre- and post-exercise, and power output, EMG activity in the active musculature, and heart rate were recorded continuously throughout exercise. Exercise was terminated when power output fell below 80% of the average recorded over the first 3 minutes of each trial. RESULTS: pre-exercise pH was higher following NaHCO3 ingestion, but post-exercise values did not differ between NaHCO3 and placebo trials. Exercise duration was 21% longer following NaHCO3 than the placebo, but no significant differences were found in power output or heart rate between trials at any point. EMG activity was higher throughout NaHCO3 trials. CONCLUSIONS: the findings of this study suggest that NaHCO3 ingestion enhanced exercise duration by allowing an increased volume of exercise to be performed prior to individuals reaching individual critical threshold values for pH. Lower neuromuscular activity despite a similar power output following NaHCO3 suggests that perceptions of effort may be based on absolute work rates rather than afferent physiological feedback, and that the work rate is achieved through regulation of efferent neural drive.
Age-of-acquisition Effects in Novel Picture Naming: a Laboratory Analogue	Age-of-acquisition (AoA) effects are such that early-acquired items are more quickly recognized and produced than later acquired items. In this laboratory analogue, participants were trained to name a group of Greeble pictures with a novel nonsense name. We manipulated order of acquisition of the stimuli: Half of the stimuli were presented from the onset of training (early acquired) whilst the other half were introduced later in the training schedule (late acquired). At test, when early and late  stimuli had equal cumulative frequency, early stimuli were named significantly faster than late items. In a second test, it was also found that visual duration thresholds were significantly smaller for the early items when participants were asked to name the critical items. These findings support the notion that order-of-acquisition effects can be manifest over a short time span in the laboratory, and that the effect of order of acquisition is distinct from mere frequency of exposure. The findings are consistent with the idea that AoA effects occurring over a large temporal scale may be a special case of more  general order-of-acquisition effects, and both may be a general property of learning mechanisms.
Can ‘Emotionally Intelligent’ Coping Promote Adaptation in Young People?	A growing body of research supports a link between emotional intelligence (EI) and better educational and health outcomes in young people. However, little is known about the processes underpinning this association. Literature suggests that EI may promote adaptation by influencing coping processes. This article evaluates how far extant research supports these claims. It is concluded that whilst EI appears to make an adaptive contribution to the mental health of young people and has the potential to do so for educational achievement, effects appear context-specific. Gaps in current knowledge are highlighted together with recommendations for progression of the field.
System Dynamics Model For Hospital Waste Characterisation and Generation in Developing Countries.	Waste management policy makers always face the problem of how to predict the future amount and composition of medical solid waste, which in turn will help determine the most appropriate treatment, recycling and disposal strategy. An accurate prediction can assist in both the planning and design of medical solid waste management systems. Insufficient budget and unavailable management capacity are the main reasons for the scarcity of medical solid waste quantities and components historical records, which are so important in long-term system planning and short-term expansion programs. This paper presents a new technique, using system dynamics modelling, to predict generated medical solid waste in a developing urban area, based on a set of limited samples from Jenin District hospitals, Palestine.  The findings of the model present the trend of medical solid waste generation together with its different components and indicate that a new forecasting approach may cover a variety of possible causative models and track inevitable uncertainties when traditional statistical least-squared regression methods are unable to handle such issues.
The Influence of Education on Community Cohesion: Adaptation of Policy to Practice	In the last 15 years, social and community cohesion have become key concepts in European social, migration, and education policy. Although their definitions often remain ambiguous, social and community cohesion typically refer to harmonious coexistence of individuals of all cultural backgrounds within a community. Frequently connected with education at the elementary and secondary level, they are regarded a desirable outcome of compulsory schooling. Drawing on longitudinal data from 2 schools in England, the authors analyze the interplay between national policies of community cohesion and local level practices. In a discussion of the findings, the authors show that, despite the gaps between national policy and local practice, parental and community members’ involvement in school and family education are efficient tools to enhance community cohesion at the local level.
Participants’ Experiences of EMDR Training.	This research projects spans a 6-year period surveying 485 participants’ experiences of eye movement  desensitization and reprocessing (EMDR) training in the United Kingdom and Ireland between the periods  of 2005 and 2011. This research used a mixed research methodology exploring EMDR training participants’  application of EMDR within their current clinical practice. The rationale was to explore potential  differences between EMDR-accredited and EMDR-nonaccredited clinicians in relation to retrospective  reports of treatment. Results indicate that EMDR-accredited clinicians report better treatment outcomes.  An argument is presented that EMDR has progressed from a convergent technique to a divergent psychotherapeutic  approach. Consequently, the research explored whether current EMDR training is “fit for  purpose.” A comprehensive model for EMDR training is outlined, proposing the importance of developing  more EMDR training in academic institutions.
Reducing Muscle Temperature Drop Post Warm-up Improves Sprint Cycling Performance.	PURPOSE:  This study aimed to determine the effect of passive insulation versus external heating during recovery following a sprint specific warm up on thigh muscle temperature and subsequent maximal sprint performance.    METHODS:  On three separate occasions, 11 male cyclists (age 24.7 ± 4.2 years, height 1.82 ± 0.72m, body mass 77.9 ± 9.8 kg; mean ± S.D.) completed a standardized 15 min intermittent warm up on a cycle ergometer, followed by a 30 min passive recovery period before completing a 30 sec maximal sprint test. Muscle temperature was measured in the vastus lateralis at 1, 2 and 3 cm depth prior to and following the warm up and immediately before the sprint test. Absolute and relative peak power output was determined and blood lactate concentration was measured immediately post-exercise. During the recovery period participants wore a tracksuit top and either i) standard tracksuit pants (CONT); ii) insulated athletic pants (INS) or; iii) insulated athletic pants with integrated electric heating elements (HEAT).    RESULTS:  Warm up increased Tm by approximately 2.5°C at all depths, with no differences between conditions. During recovery, Tm remained elevated in HEAT compared to INS and CONT at all depths (p<0.001). Both peak and relative power output were elevated by 9.6% and 9.1% respectively in HEAT compared to CONT (both p<0.05). The increase in blood lactate concentration was greater (p<0.05) post sprint in HEAT (6.3 ± 1.8 mmol/L) but not INS (4.0 ± 1.8 mmol/L) vs. CONT (4.1 ± 1.9 mmol/L).    CONCLUSION:  Passive heating of the thighs between warm up completion and performance execution using pants incorporating electrically heated pads can attenuate the decline in Tm and improve sprint cycling performance.
The Role of Evidence in General Managers’ Decision-making	This paper presents an overview of current academic theory on evidence-based management  (EBM) and considers the extent to which the decision-making processes of 39 senior, general  managers are consistent with this thinking. In the pursuit of this aim the study has utilised  inductive reasoning, qualitative data, purposeful sampling and semi-structured interviews,  based upon the critical incident technique (Flanagan, 1954), to obtain detailed information  regarding the decision-making processes utilised by each of the interviewees in relation to their  most challenging managerial situations. It has been shown that these interviewees utilised only  one of the four main sources of evidence for management decision-making proposed by Briner  and Rousseau (2011). In the light of this finding, ways are identified in which managers may be  able to enhance their business practice by utilising more sources of evidence. In addition, the  study has also identified ways in which current academic thinking needs to be developed so that  it incorporates all of the practices that general managers have utilised. Finally, the implications  for general managers are discussed.
Review of 'A Theory of Craft; Function and Aesthetic Experience'	A Theory of Craft; Function and Aesthetic Experience  Howard Risatti The University of North Carolina Press    Howard Risatti proposes a theory of craft that is born out of a relationship between function and aesthetic experience. This position at once connects natural forms to human needs, as in a nest to the basket, or a watering hole to the bowl, with the meanings that these archetypes are able to carry.......
Client Discourses on the Process of Seeking Same-sex Couple Counselling	How same-sex couples manage the process of seeking help for their relationships is an under-researched area. Twelve semi-structured interviews were conducted with 16 people who had engaged in same-sex couple counselling, and were analysed using discourse analysis. The ways in which the couples positioned themselves as part of a ‘minority group’, or part of a generic group of couples struggling with relationship issues, impacted on how they discussed seeking help. We conclude that counsellors and psychotherapists need to be aware of the ways in which couples construct their relationships, and mindful of the tricky navigations around similarity to, and difference from, different-sex relationships. The impact of this on couples seeking therapeutic help is considered.
Self-monitoring of Blood Glucose in Black Caribbean and South Asian Canadians with Non-insulin Treated Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: A Qualitative Study of Patients’ Perspectives.	Abstract  Background:To examine the views and current practice of SMBG among Black Caribbean and South Asian  individuals with non-insulin treated Type 2 diabetes mellitus.  Methods: Twelve participants completed semi-structured interviews that were guided by the Health Belief Model  and analyzed using thematic network analysis.  Results: The frequency of monitoring among participants varied from several times a day to once per week. Most  participants expressed similar experiences regarding their views and practices of SMBG. Minor differences across  gender and culture were observed. All participants understood the benefits, but not all viewed SMBG as beneficialto their personal diabetes management. SMBG can facilitate a better understanding and maintenance of self-care behaviours. However, it can trigger both positive and negative emotional responses, such as a sense of  disappointment when high readings are not anticipated, resulting in emotional distress. Health care professionals  play a key role in the way SMBG is perceived and used by patients.  Conclusion:While the majority of participants value SMBG as a self-management tool, barriers exist that impede its  practice, particularly its cost. How individuals cope with these barriers is integral to understanding why some  patients adopt SMBG more than others.
'He Was Like a Zombie': Off-label Prescription of Antipsychotic Drugs in Dementia	This paper explores the legal position of the off-label prescription of antipsychotic medications to people with dementia who experience behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD). Dementia is a challenging illness, and BPSD can be very difficult for carers to manage, with evidence that this contributes to carer strain and can result in the early institutionalisation of people with dementia. As a result, the prescription of antipsychotic and other neuroleptic medications to treat BPSD has become commonplace, in spite of these drugs being untested and unlicensed for use to treat older people with dementia. In recent years, it has become apparent through clinical trials that antipsychotic drugs increase the risk of cerebrovascular accident (stroke) and death in people with dementia. In addition, these types of medication also have other risk factors for people with dementia, including over-sedation and worsening of cognitive function. Drawing on recent questionnaire (n=185), focus group (n=15), and interview (n=11) data with carers of people with dementia, this paper explores the law relating to off-label prescription, and the applicability of medical negligence law to cases where adverse events follow the use of antipsychotic medication. It is argued that the practice of off-label prescribing requires regulatory intervention in order to protect vulnerable patients.
A Model for Proactively Insuring SMEs in the Supply Chain Against Cyber Risk	There has been increasing concern in recent years about the lack of urgency in SMEs regarding security of their information. Concern stems not only from the risks the SMEs are taking not only with their own data, but also with the data they share with supply chain partners. Current surveys have shown that the situation is getting worse with human error compounded by cybercriminals exploiting weaknesses in SME systems and using them to hack supply chain hubs.    In this paper, a researcher and a practitioner from the UK investigate possible reasons for SME apparent lack of interest in securing data, or developing information security management systems (ISMSs). In the absence of UK legislation, the only way SMEs are likely en masse to improve their information security is through pressure from supply chain partners and particularly supply chain hubs. The authors present an interesting development in cyber liability insurance which provides the basis for a cost-effective solution that will encourage good information assurance across the supply chain.
The Influence of New School Buildings upon the Motivation Morale and Job Satisfaction of Teaching Professionals	This research was conducted in response to a government policy to create new school buildings in the United Kingdom. It sought to examine the influence such schools had upon teaching professionals in terms of their motivation, morale and job satisfaction. Using semi-structured interviews, this qualitative, longitudinal study, has focused on two new schools in a rural/urban target authority in the Midlands of the United Kingdom.  The findings support the notion that by creating new schools that teaching professional’s motivation, morale and job satisfaction may be positively influenced and this in turn has a positive impact upon their professional identities. The findings also illustrate that if centrally imposed initiatives are of a context specific nature then they will lead to empowered professionals.  However for some individuals within the profession their initial calling to work with children and alongside colleagues prove to be just as important for their professional motivation and job satisfaction.
The Influence of New School Buildings upon the Motivation,   Morale and Job Satisfaction of Teaching Professionals	The focus for the research is rooted in a recent Labour’s Government (1997-2010) policy of creating new school buildings which involved injecting large amounts of government capital into flagship initiatives such as ‘Schools for the Future’ (DFES, 2002) and ‘Building Schools for the Future’, (BSF) (DFES, 2003). This resulted in the establishment of 1,100 new school buildings over a 10 year period (DCSF, 2008) and led to the injection of £55 billion worth of capital investment. However, as a direct result of the global recession in 2008 and the need for the newly elected coalition government of both the Liberals and Conservatives under the leadership of David Cameron to rein in spending, that Labour’s flagship policies of creating new schools were cancelled in 2010. This resigned the 20-year school building programme to history and the resultant scrapping 715 projects and the saving of £169 million worth of capital monies (Guardian, 2010).    Though forming part of a post-graduate thesis, this research was conceived to investigate the outcomes of such a wide ranging policy upon teaching professionals who now find themselves working in such new school buildings. This research was also designed to fill what is  a paucity of research available relating to the influence of these new schools upon the motivation, morale and job satisfaction of teaching professionals. Given the cessation of Labour’s policy of large capital investment in the creation of new school buildings this research now serves to illustrate the important and value that capital investment in schools merely beyond the creating what may be seen as improved facilities and teaching and learning environments.
Reimagining Athletic Nudity: The Sexualization of Sport as a Sign of a ‘Porno-ization’ of Culture	This paper traces some historical and contemporary instances in which sporting and other bodies naked physiques have been utilized to affect religious, social, ideological, or political agendas. We argue inherent aesthetic values of performative flesh have been lost (or minimized) in recent times which have, intentionally or otherwise, degraded, and objectified the naked body. To satisfy society’s insatiable consumer needs and desires, bodies, especially sporting bodies, have been sexualized to the extreme. This overt sexualization is symptomatic of a wider porno-ization of Western (North American and European) culture and cultural products. Porno-ization (characterized by exploitative modes of production for pecuniary gain) has limited our contemporary readings, and respect for, the body and its educational, transformative, artistic, and emancipatory potential. Tentative though our theorization may be, we call readers to appreciate athletic nudity anew; to reimagine the eroticism of sporting bodies in cultural and aesthetic terms, akin to artistic appreciation, rather, than as provocative objects of sports’ capitalistic desires.
An Evaluation of Older Adults Use of iPads in Eleven UK Care-Homes	The introduction of the iPad and similar form-factor devices (e.g. Samsung Galaxy Tab, Asus Eee Pad and Motorola Xoom) has provided a unique opportunity for older adults to engage with mobile computing devices and platforms. Engagement with ‘traditional’ computing devices amongst older adults, including arguably mobile devices, such as laptop computers is low due to dexterity issues amongst this population (Hertzum & Hornbaek, 2010). Whilst the iPad removes some of the traditional barriers to computer engagement, new barriers including weight and screen reflection are evident to an older user group. This paper provides an exploratory evaluation of how older adults in 11 UK care-home settings and the staff engaged in their care are using iPads to help improve communication, build physical social networks amongst residents, staff and family members, and map the most frequently used applications by an older population during a six-month pilot period. Results suggest that applications involving information searching for personally related and historical information were most valued by older adults. Further, older adults and care staff alike report mainly positive experiences of iPad use in care settings including the increased opportunities for social interaction and the enhancement of intergenerational communication. Additionally, the barriers to use (e.g. device weight) are often overcome by low-tech adaptations and adjustment when using the device. This paper argues that the portability and adaptive nature of the iPad combined with the increased social interaction afforded by device could increase quality of life in care settings.
The Value Paradox – Inducting Undergraduate University Students in a Time of Austerity.	The challenges facing UK higher education are both well documented and controversial; however, pitted against  this context is the requirement for psychology departments to provide an increasingly rich and diverse university  experience for students, whilst ensuring progression and retention remain central to undergraduate provision.  Despite the recognition that induction is of upmost importance in ensuring a successful transition from pretertiary to higher education, many universities are faced with changing budgets in the post-Browne era (Browne,  2010) across all aspects of academic life. Such a challenge presents departments with a unique paradox since  student expectations continue to rise as the dominance of consumerism reaches fruition, whilst budgets continue  to decrease. In acknowledging the importance of induction for both the overall student experience and for  retention, the University of Worcester designed and successfully implemented an induction programme on a  considerably reduced budget. A satisfaction questionnaire was completed by 136 undergraduate students  inducted in 2011 and the results compared to those of 87 students from 2010 (where the induction budget was  considerably higher). The results indicate similar levels of satisfaction and engagement with induction activities  and whilst an off-site activity remains key to the success of induction, such an activity doesn’t have to present  considerable expense. This paper provides an overview of designing an induction programme on a reduced  budget, presents satisfaction results from undergraduate students who completed induction in both 2010 and  2011, and presents suggestions for best practice in the design of induction events for psychology undergraduates.
Relationship Between General and Specific Coordination in 8- to 17-Year-Old Male Basketball Players.	The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationships  between general coordination, sport-specifi c coordination, and sport-specifi c  fi tness of 8- to 17-year-old male basketball players. 312 males with training experience  ranging from one year in the 8-year-old cohort up to 10 years for the 17-yearolds  performed basketball-specifi c fi tness (20 m sprint, Illinois, countermovement  jump), general coordination (20 m run with three obstacles), semi-basketball-specifi  c coordination (20 m sprint dribbling two balls, countermovement jump with  arm swing) and basketball-specifi c coordination (Illinois ball dribbling) tests. There  were moderate to large correlations between the results of both general and basketball-  specifi c coordination with the results of most basketball-specifi c coordination  tests in all age groups. Correlations between general and basketball-specifi c coordination  were large in four age groups (11–14 yr., r = .52 to r = .76), moderate in fi ve  groups (8–10, 15 & 16 yr., r = .37 to r = .46), while not signifi cant in the 17-year-olds.  These results suggest that the importance of general coordination for sport-specifi c  skills improvements during a sports-specifi c skill acquisition phase, remains high  at the skill refi nement phase, and decreases when sport-specifi c skills have been  mastered to near-perfection.
Collective Identity and Contested Allegiance: A Case of Migrant Professional Fijian Rugby Players	Rugby is widely regarded as Fiji’s ‘national’ sport and Fijian athletes are a prominent  global presence in professional rugby today. Despite such prominence of Fijian athletes  in professional rugby and the social, economic and symbolic significance of the sport in  Fiji, there is a near absence of academic research on Fijian rugby migration. As Fiji has  been deeply implicated in the interests and discourses of colonialism, ethnonationalism  and masculinity, the aim of this study is to explore professional rugby  migration and international competitions as a context for collective identification by  focusing on the interview-generated voices of rugby migrants as well as popular media  discourses. In doing so, we aim to provide an insight into the multiple dimensions of  sport labour migration from the point of view of a developing society that supplies sport  labour across the globe. Our analysis will highlight the complex and contested nature of  rugby migration as it is experienced and viewed by emigrant players and the Fiji public  with a specific focus on the tension between core and periphery dimensions which  surfaces at times of international competition such as the Rugby World Cup.
Development of Social Relationships, Interactions and Behaviours in Early Education Settings	Recent research and policy regarding the advantages of early years provision has focused largely on the enhancement and development of cognitive skills for preschoolers. This study, based in the United Kingdom, focuses on a range of cognitive and social skills and identifies beneficial characteristics of a government pilot scheme for 2-year-olds in areas of social disadvantage. Data were collected from nursery managers and parents across six early years settings using a combination of qualitative and quantitative methods centred around in-depth observational techniques focused on children. Results indicate that in addition to the development of cognitive skills, children showed increased confidence and modes of communication and interaction and that these were associated with the varied activities and routines established within the early years settings. Some variations in terms of frequency and quality of interactions, activities and practice were identified in settings; however, interpersonal support for learning and development was consistent across settings.
Our Distinguished Son: The New Zealand Olympic Committee and the Reappropriation of Jack Lovelock	During the 1920s, New Zealand, in common with other nations,  experienced a period of fluctuating economic conditions, a changing political landscape, and, a resurgence of a (masculine) sports culture.  Stronger trans-Tasman relations and a renewed sense of imperial allegiance, for instance, prompted nationalistic and patriotic resurgence. In addition, regional parochialism challenged the partisanship of central government, growing discontent among working class labourers over wage and working conditions rocked trade industries, concerns over indigenous health and welfare thwarted racial harmony; and global conflict threatened national security and colonial ties.  These tumultuous forces precipitated a reappraisal of New Zealand’s economic position, national direction, identity, and culture, which, in turn, also influenced the country’s sports organisations. Indeed, sport was an active constituent in many of the social and cultural tensions and conflicts in New Zealand life.  Social and cultural forces also influenced the amateur New Zealand Olympic Committee (NZOC) and its involvement in the Olympic Movement. During this time NZOC sent the country’s first ‘national’ team to an Olympic Games and athletes celebrated the first exclusively ‘New Zealand’ Olympic victories. In what follows I examine how NZOC capitalised on the expertise and popularity of Jack Lovelock - one of the country’s top scholars and emerging middle-distance running star of the 1930s – to help develop the organisation and prepare it for future adversities. By re-appropriating Lovelock for their own purposes, I contend, NZOC fortified their own public persona (by basking in reflected glory), and, showed their professional responsibility by demonstrating an attentiveness to athlete concerns; both of which became enduring issues for the organisation.
Using Social Networks as a Catalyst for Change in Global Higher Education Marketing and Recruiting.	Higher education institutes (HEIs) throughout the world are  recognising the potential of using social networking as an outreach method for their marketing and recruiting campaigns and can serve as a catalyst for strategic change within the education sector. This study researched 90 universities in Asia, Africa and Europe to their use of social networking for educational recruiting and marketing. Results showed that HEIs in certain geographic areas do use it, but results are inconsistent among the globe. The innovative functionality provided by social networking has challenged HEI officials who may be inexperienced at utilising the full potential of these sites to better serve the school and its stakeholders. However, it is important that HEIs integrate the use of social media into their marketing programmes in order to better reach their intended audiences and provide for a more successful education experience for students.
A Positive Library Experience for International Students?  Results from a Business Librarians Association survey	The theme of the annual Business Librarians Association BLA) three-day conference held at Stirling Management  Centre during summer 2012 was ‘Going global? Challenges of internationalisation’. Business schools in the UK attract large numbers of international students,2 and the conference  aimed to explore how business librarians can help provide a positive experience for international students.    To support this theme, three business librarians, Stephen Bull from University of Birmingham,Stephanie Allen from University of Worcester and Alison Lahlafi from Sheffield Hallam University, collaborated on a survey of BLA members services to international students.
Self-care Management Education Models in Primary Care	Self-care management for people living with long-term conditions aims to assist the individual in taking responsibility for their own health. This literature  review explores the value and content of the large range of educational models currently in use. Although no single model was found that addressed all the issues, several themes arose. These included the observation that educational models should be based on self-efficacy principles and patient-centred. Method of delivery favoured small groups, using a variety of approaches supported  with written information. Duration of the programmes was mainly 6–8 weeks with a follow-up. Programmes should be offered when the patient is ready and not determined by the condition or at diagnosis. Debate remains over whether  group leaders should be laypeople and professionals; powever, a mixture of both offered the best outcomes. Programmes should not be problem-focused, offering space for support and experience sharing.
Validity and Reliability of a 1500-m Lap-Time Collection  Method Using Public Videos	The collection of retrospective lap times from video footage is a potentially useful research tool to analyze the pacing strategies in any number of competitive events. The aim of this study was to validate a novel method of obtaining running split-time data from publically available video footage. Videos of the 1500-m men’s final from the 2004 and 2008 Olympics, 2005 and 2009 World Championships, and 2010 European Championships  were obtained from the YouTube Web site, and split times were collected from all competitors using  frame-by-frame playback. The typical error of video split times ranged between 0.02 s and 0.11 s for the 4  laps when compared with official split times. Video finishing times were also similar to official finishing times (typical error of 0.04 s). The method was shown to be highly reliable with a typical error of 0.02 s when the same video was analyzed on 2 occasions separated by 8 mo. Video data of track races are widely available;  however, camera angles are not always perpendicular to the start/finish line, and some slower athletes may  cross the line after the camera has panned away. Nevertheless, the typical errors reported here show that when appropriate camera angles are available this method is both valid and reliable.
Using Social Worlds Theory to Explore Influences on  Community Nurses’ Experiences of Providing Out of Hours Paediatric Palliative Care	Abstract  Background: Paediatric oncology palliative care in the community is rare and nationally there is  a lack of standardisation of out of hours nursing service provision.  Objectives: This paper seeks to explore influences on the experiences of paediatric nurses providing out of hours palliative care within the family home to children with cancer. The study used social worlds theory to aid identification and demonstration of the findings.  Methods: Twelve community-based palliative cases were purposively selected from children with cancer treated at one regional centre. Tape-recorded interviews were undertaken with 54 health professionals (general practitioners, community nurses and allied health professionals) involved in providing their palliative care and five facilitated case discussions completed. Data analysis  followed a grounded theory approach; chronological comparative data analysis identifying generated themes. Social worlds theory was used as a framework to examine the data.  Results: Nurses’ experiences are shaped by their social world and those of the nursing team,child and family and the inter-professional team providing the care. The lack of a formalised service, sub-optimal inter-professional working and impact of social worlds influence the experience of the nurse.  Conclusions: Social worlds theory provided a new perspective in understanding these experiences based within a paediatric palliative care setting, knowledge that can be used to inform service provision.
Changing Personas and Evolving Identities: the Contestation and Renegotiation of Researcher Roles in Fieldwork.	The aim of this paper is to discuss the development and evolution of particular personas adopted  by researchers in the quest for rich exchanges within the social field. It analyses my role (the  principal author) as a female ethnographer (and the sole female) in the world of elite male rowing.  Data are drawn from personal notes, reflections and observations during a five-month-long training  camp. My experiences are located within dramaturgical social theory and, in particular, Goffman’s work on face and impression management. The significance of the work is twofold. Firstly, it lies in recognising the strategies we use and the identities we construct as researchers in negotiating the social field towards desired ends. Secondly, it raises awareness of the implications performances have for the nature of the data gathered and the conclusions drawn from them.
Working Beyond 65: a Qualitative Study of Perceived Hazards and Discomforts at Work.	This qualitative study explored self-reports of hazards and discomforts in the workplace and coping strategies among those choosing to work beyond the age of 65 years.  Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 30 people aged 66-91 years. Most worked part-time in professional or administrative roles. Participants described some hazards and discomforts in their current work, but no recent accidents. The main age-related discomfort was tiredness. Other hazards that recurred in participants’ accounts were physical demands of the job, driving, and interpersonal difficulties such as client or customer complaints, and in very rare cases, bullying. Most work-related hazards (e.g. prolonged sitting at computers, lifting heavy items and driving) were thought likely to affect any worker regardless of age. Coping strategies included making adaptations to age-related changes (such as decreased stamina) by keeping fit and being open about difficulties to colleagues, reducing hours of work, altering roles at work, limiting driving, applying expertise derived from previous work experiences, being assertive, using authority and status, and (among the minority employed in larger organisations) making use of supportive company/organisational policies and practices. Overall, the sample took individual responsibility for managing hazards at work and perceived little or no elevation of risk linked to age.
‘It’s Almost Like Talking to a Person’: Student Disclosure to Pedagogical Agents in Sensitive Settings.	This paper presents findings of a pilot study which used pedagogical agents to examine disclosure in educational settings. The study used responsive evaluation to explore how use of pedagogical agents might affect students’ truthfulness and disclosure by asking them to respond to a lifestyle choices survey delivered by a web-based pedagogical agent. Findings indicate that emotional connection with pedagogical agents were intrinsic to the user’s sense of trust and therefore likely to affect levels of truthfulness and engagement. The implications of this study are that truthfulness, personalisation and emotional engagement are all vital components in using pedagogical agents to enhance online learning.
Turning Brass to Muck? A Small Scale Exploration of Charities Use of Charity Bags Collections	The title of this paper is an inversion of the usual cliché of turning muck to brass, which it is arguable that charity bag collections do, by providing an in income for charities for goods that would normally be thrown away.  While previous research has highlighted that charity bag collections are becoming an increasingly significant source of income for charities, enabling charities to metaphorically turn muck into brass, research has been rather disparate in its analysis of four main issues highlighted as pertinent to this growth.  These are: the frequency of collection requests; the amount of materials collections provide; the amount of commission received by charities from outsourced collections, and the extent of bogus/fraudulent collections. This paper uses data collected over a 12 month period using a convenience sampling method to explore these issues in some empirical detail.  The findings particularly suggest in that there are a number of processes through which charities undertake their collections which risks undermining the current and future income from charity bags, and which thereby has the potential to  invert the metaphor, and turn what has become muck to brass into brass to muck, thereby losing out on a significant income stream.
Intentional Rounding - A Critique of the Evidence	Intentional rounding has been heavily  promoted by the prime minister David  Cameron and others and is being widely  implemented in UK hospitals. It is claimed  that the practice has a number of benefits,  including reduction in call bell use, falls and  pressure ulcers and increased satisfaction.  In this article, I will submit these claims to  close scrutiny and argue that the evidence  base is too flimsy to support the claims.  Similarly, the Friends and Family test is  being implemented despite the absence of  any supportive evidence. The Francis  report stated that change cannot be  implemented through top-down  pronouncements, and yet this is exactly  what is happening with rounding and the  Friends and Family test.  Individual nurses and nurse managers  should look more to evidence than to  political expedience when implementing  nursing policies.
Why is Research Still Invisible in Further Education?	This article takes as its starting point earlier research reported by Geoffrey Elliott in 1996. That study found that research was consistantly marginalised in the FE sector, and identified a number of structural factors that contributed to this ‘invisibility’. This new study draws upon a small sample of lecturers who belong to a Further and Higher Education Early Years Partnership. Through the participants’ voices and perspectives, the authors identify continuing dissonance and issues of research marginalisation. The discussion also highlights contemporary educational discourse, with its predominant focus upon measurable value at the expense of values, as a key factor in sustaining a culture that is antithetic to thoughtful reflection and research. The authors identify the development of a ‘collaborative centralised’ research community as critical to an alternative possibility for research in further education.
The Impact of Ramadan on Lifestyle Behaviours and Implications for Cardiac Rehabilitation: A Review	Introduction: The Muslim population worldwide have a higher incidence of cardiovascular disease than that of the non-Muslim population, and this may become exaggerated during the religious observances of Ramadan. This review assessed the evidence regarding the impact of Ramadan on lifestyle behaviours in Muslims with cardiovascular disease.   Method: This article reviews the literature concerning the impact of Ramadan on lifestyle behaviours and its effects on cardiac rehabilitation between 2000 and 2012. Studies were identified, using Academic Search Complete, Google Scholar, Psyclnfo, PsycARTICLES, Medline and CINAHL Plus. The search terms used were: 'cardiac rehabilitation'; 'cardiovascular disease'; 'Ramadan'; 'fasting'; 'physical activity'; 'exercise'; 'diet'; 'smoking'; 'sleep'; 'behaviour change'; 'medication'; and 'treatment'.   Findings: Evidence suggests that fasting during Ramadan can have a beneficial effect on factors such as cholesterol levels, body weight and blood pressure; however, benefits are rarely sustained in the long term. Other behavioural changes such as non-adherence to medication, and diet and exercise regimes have more negative consequences for sufferers of cardiac disease.   Conclusions: Lifestyle behaviours adopted during Ramadan can have a negative impact on cardiovascular disease. Health professionals are urged to find innovative ways to engage this population in healthy lifestyle choices throughout this period.
‘New’ Migrants in the British Countryside	The eastward expansion of the European Union (EU) in the early 2000s had a number of consequences. One of these, deriving from the EU principle of freedom of movement and the associated relaxation of border restrictions, was a  marked increase in migration from the new member states into the longer established western ones. Within the United Kingdom much of that migration was towards larger urban centres, but a relatively high (and perhaps unexpected)  proportion was to smaller towns, villages and more rural areas. This article explores the extent of this migration and, more specifically, it seeks to highlight some of the reactions to it. In doing so, there is a focus on rural parts of the English west midlands, in particular the county of Herefordshire. The article places this migratory movement within the context of increased east-west  migration more generally, the regulatory environment surrounding it, and the broader responses to it at a national level.
The Changing Face of Adoption in England: Opportunities and Dilemmas	The Coalition Government in England has recently undertaken a radical review of adoption services. Informed by business and managerial principles, the government strategy, ‘An Action Plan for Adoption: Tackling Delay’ (DfE, 2012a), is designed to increase the number of adoptions, widen the pool of adoptive applicants and reduce the costs occurred by keeping children unnecessarily in the looked after system of care. The new strategy has been opposed by many in the social work profession who fear that a speeding up of the adoption process will erode social work values and practice. Previous governments have attempted to bring about radical change in adoption practices across England, but with little success. The paper reviews some of the dilemmas raised by the new adoption proposals, such as the opportunity to bring about success and to change the outcomes for children needing adoption as supported by the body of research into the potential positive effects of adoption on children’s outcome. However the paper is questioning whether managerialist tools such as league tables of local authority performance have any place in child-centred adoption practice.
Patients’ Experiences of Negative Pressure Wound Therapy for the Treatment of Wounds: a Review	To review the research on patients’ experiences of undergoing negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT). A literature search was carried out using the following databases: Academic Search Complete, CINAHL, PsychINFO, MEDLINE, PubMed and PsyARTICLES. The search covered the period from 2001 to 2012, using the key words: [‘negative pressure wound therapy’ OR ‘vacuum-assisted closure’ OR ‘topical negative therapy’] AND [‘patients’ experiences’ OR ‘psychological’ OR ‘stress’ OR ‘anxiety’ OR ‘wellbeing’ OR ‘pain’ OR ‘quality of life’ OR ‘physical’]. Twenty-five relevant articles were included. NPWT is generally considered to be successful in reducing wound depth and facilitating healing. However, studies have highlighted a number of issues that need to be considered. For example, the type of dressing used during treatment can have a significant effect on patients’ experience of pain. Furthermore, the NPWT system can cause patients to feel  anxious due to both the patient and the health professional being unfamiliar with this form of treatment. It can also restrict patients’ daily care and wider social life, which may result in a negative self-image and low self-esteem. Despite this, some studies have reported positive improvements to patients’ quality of life. Additionally, since NPWT can lead to faster healing, any detrimental impact upon patients’ wellbeing may be short-term and less prolonged than that of other treatments. Compared with other treatments, there is evidence to show that NPWT can lead to faster wound healing, and a reduced frequency of dressing changes and other treatments. However, there are a number of challenges with the use of NPWT, which need to be explored further so that improvements can be made. Specifically, certain aspects of NPWT may impact negatively on patients’ wellbeing, albeit shortterm. Therefore, research needs to explore patients’ experiences of NPWT throughout the treatment process and to consider how this can be improved to minimise any negative effects.
Is Online Patchwork Text Assessment a Panacea for Assessment Practices in Higher Education?	Although assessment is acknowledged as being of central importance to the student learning experience,  assessment practices have been consistently highlighted as one of the weakest features by the Quality Assurance  Agency and identified by many as a crisis within higher education. This paper explores the use of Patchwork  Text Assessment within a level 6 undergraduate psychology module and considers the potential of this method  for enhancing the learning experiences of psychology undergraduates, facilitating the process of self-reflection  and allowing students to make explicit the nature of their learning ‘journey’.
Challenging Teenage and Young Adult Reading in the UK: The Novels of Philip Reeve	A discussion of Philip Reeve's 'No Such Thing As Dragons' (2009) and 'Here Lies Arthur' (2007)
Alienation, Agency and Authenticity: a Synthesis of Practice and Effects in Student Engagement.	In recent years a number of authors have undertaken extensive reviews of the international research literature to investigate student engagement in higher education. This paper presents the findings of a study that undertook a project to synthesise the qualitative research literature systematically, through the use of qualitative research synthesis. The concepts and themes that have recurred across the student engagement literature which are discussed in terms of four themed approaches to student engagement. c The challenges and opportunities of using the methodology are presented along with providing a number of recommendations for further research regarding integrated approaches to student engagement.
Arabidopsis RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN30 and Receptor-Like Kinase SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1-1/EVERSHED Mediate Innate Immunity to Necrotrophic Fungi	Effective plant defense strategies rely in part on the perception of non-self determinants, so-called microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs), by transmembrane pattern recognition receptors leading to MAMP-triggered immunity. Plant resistance against necrotrophic pathogens with a broad host range is complex and yet not well understood. Particularly, it is unclear if resistance to necrotrophs involves pattern recognition receptors. Here, we partially purified a novel proteinaceous elicitor called SCLEROTINIA CULTURE FILTRATE ELICITOR1 (SCFE1) from the necrotrophic fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum that induces typical MAMP-triggered immune responses in Arabidopsis thaliana. Analysis of natural genetic variation revealed five Arabidopsis accessions (Mt-0, Lov-1, Lov-5, Br-0, and Sq-1) that are fully insensitive to the SCFE1-containing fraction. We used a forward genetics approach and mapped the locus determining SCFE1 sensitivity to RECEPTOR-LIKE PROTEIN30 (RLP30). We also show that SCFE1-triggered immune responses engage a signaling pathway dependent on the regulatory receptor-like kinases BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE1-ASSOCIATED RECEPTOR KINASE1 (BAK1) and SUPPRESSOR OF BIR1-1/EVERSHED (SOBIR1/EVR). Mutants of RLP30, BAK1, and SOBIR1 are more susceptible to S. sclerotiorum and the related fungus Botrytis cinerea. The presence of an elicitor in S. sclerotiorum evoking MAMP-triggered immune responses and sensed by RLP30/SOBIR1/BAK1 demonstrates the relevance of MAMP-triggered immunity in resistance to necrotrophic fungi.
