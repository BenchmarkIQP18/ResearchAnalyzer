      "abstract": "Purpose: This practice-focused study explores the value students place on the Sustainable Strategies Game which seeks to improve student engagement in business sustainability through enhanced game-based learning. This game provides an alternative collaborative learning environment to the traditional instructivist approach in order to enrich Education for Sustainability learning experiences and enhance student engagement.\r\nDesign\/Methodology\/Approach: Students’ reflections on their game-based learning experiences and suggestions for game development were collected through a short qualitative survey. Results are explored through three frameworks, the Multifaceted Student Value Model, the Dimensions of Engagement Framework and the UK Higher Education Authority Framework for Engagement Through Partnership.\r\nFindings: Research findings suggest the Sustainable Strategies Game provides game-based learning within Education for Sustainability that delivers ‘edutainment’ within an active, collaborative and experiential learning environment that the students value. It is also able to challenge thinking and emotionally engage students with the fundamentals of business sustainability. Reflection-on-action and the students’ role as co-researchers in game development allow students to become active participants in their learning as well as knowledge producers and evaluators. These outcomes deliver the UK Higher Education Authority’s core facets of student engagement through partnership.\r\nResearch limitations\/implications: This practice-focused study presents the self-reported results of a one-time, small study which does not offer generalised, independently validated responses. However, the findings may be of interest to educators considering the adoption of game-based learning and those seeking new learning cultures for EfS.\r\nPractical Implications: Game-based learning and teaching approaches can achieve a learner-centred active, collaborative learning environment that enhances student engagement with business sustainability.\r\nOriginality\/Value: Experiences gained from this study should assist others in the implementation of game-based learning to engage students in business sustainability.",

This game provides an alternative collaborative learning environment to the traditional instructivist approach in order to enrich Education for Sustainability learning experiences and enhance student engagement.\r\nDesign\/Methodology\/Approach: Students’ reflections on their game-based learning experiences and suggestions for game development were collected through a short qualitative survey. Results are explored through three frameworks, the Multifaceted Student Value Model, the Dimensions of Engagement Framework and the UK Higher Education Authority Framework for Engagement Through Partnership.\r\nFindings: Research findings suggest the Sustainable Strategies Game provides game-based learning within Education for Sustainability that delivers ‘edutainment’ within an active, collaborative and experiential learning environment that the students value. It is also able to challenge thinking and emotionally engage students with the fundamentals of business sustainability. Reflection-on-action and the students’ role as co-researchers in game development allow students to become active participants in their learning as well as knowledge producers and evaluators. These outcomes deliver the UK Higher Education Authority’s core facets of student engagement through partnership.\r\nResearch limitations\/implications: This practice-focused study presents the self-reported results of a one-time, small study which does not offer generalised, independently validated responses. However, the findings may be of interest to educators considering the adoption of game-based learning and those seeking new learning cultures for EfS.\r\nPractical Implications: Game-based learning and teaching approaches can achieve a learner-centred active, collaborative learning environment that enhances student engagement with business sustainability.\r\nOriginality\/Value: Experiences gained from this study should assist others in the implementation of game-based learning to engage students in business sustainability.",

      "rioxx2_description": "The need to ensure that learners acquire the knowledge and skills required to promote sustainable development and evolving preferences for experiential and collaborative learning within Higher Education are reshaping approaches to Education for Sustainability. In response the Sustainable Strategies Game seeks to provide experiential game-based learning and teaching for business sustainability within Worcester Business School. \r\nThe Sustainable Strategies Game aims to stimulate collaborative engagement in business strategy making that promotes sustainability literacy skills, the adoption of sustainable practices, the sustainable use of common resources (freshwater) and encourages students to explore the equitable sharing of benefits gained from the use of this generic resource.\r\nThis paper presents qualitative evidence from research conducted into student perceptions’ of the effectiveness of SSG as a new way to learn and think about business sustainability.  It utilises the HEA Framework for Engagement through Partnership and the Framework for Engagement in Game-based Learning and Teaching to explore the value the Sustainable Strategies Game has for experiential and collaborative learning for Education for Sustainability and its ability to engage students in the complexities of integrating social, environmental and economic impacts of consuming natural resources within business operations. The findings suggest that the Sustainable Strategies Game provides an entertaining learning environment that challenges sustainability thinking and behaviours and encourages students to engage with the key principles of business sustainability and investigate business strategies that carry less impact on society and the environment.",

      "abstract": "The need to ensure that learners acquire the knowledge and skills required to promote sustainable development and evolving preferences for experiential and collaborative learning within Higher Education are reshaping approaches to Education for Sustainability. In response the Sustainable Strategies Game seeks to provide experiential game-based learning and teaching for business sustainability within Worcester Business School. \r\nThe Sustainable Strategies Game aims to stimulate collaborative engagement in business strategy making that promotes sustainability literacy skills, the adoption of sustainable practices, the sustainable use of common resources (freshwater) and encourages students to explore the equitable sharing of benefits gained from the use of this generic resource.\r\nThis paper presents qualitative evidence from research conducted into student perceptions’ of the effectiveness of SSG as a new way to learn and think about business sustainability.  It utilises the HEA Framework for Engagement through Partnership and the Framework for Engagement in Game-based Learning and Teaching to explore the value the Sustainable Strategies Game has for experiential and collaborative learning for Education for Sustainability and its ability to engage students in the complexities of integrating social, environmental and economic impacts of consuming natural resources within business operations. The findings suggest that the Sustainable Strategies Game provides an entertaining learning environment that challenges sustainability thinking and behaviours and encourages students to engage with the key principles of business sustainability and investigate business strategies that carry less impact on society and the environment.",

      "abstract": "The need to ensure that learners acquire the knowledge and skills required to promote sustainable development and evolving preferences for experiential and collaborative learning within Higher Education are reshaping approaches to Education for Sustainability. In response the Sustainable Strategies Game seeks to provide experiential game-based learning and teaching for business sustainability within Worcester Business School. \r\nThe Sustainable Strategies Game aims to stimulate collaborative engagement in business strategy making that promotes sustainability literacy skills, the adoption of sustainable practices, the sustainable use of common resources (freshwater) and encourages students to explore the equitable sharing of benefits gained from the use of this generic resource.\r\nThis paper presents qualitative evidence from research conducted into student perceptions’ of the effectiveness of SSG as a new way to learn and think about business sustainability.  It utilises the HEA Framework for Engagement through Partnership and the Framework for Engagement in Game-based Learning and Teaching to explore the value the Sustainable Strategies Game has for experiential and collaborative learning for Education for Sustainability and its ability to engage students in the complexities of integrating social, environmental and economic impacts of consuming natural resources within business operations. The findings suggest that the Sustainable Strategies Game provides an entertaining learning environment that challenges sustainability thinking and behaviours and encourages students to engage with the key principles of business sustainability and investigate business strategies that carry less impact on society and the environment.",

In response the Sustainable Strategies Game seeks to provide experiential game-based learning and teaching for business sustainability within Worcester Business School. \r\nThe Sustainable Strategies Game aims to stimulate collaborative engagement in business strategy making that promotes sustainability literacy skills, the adoption of sustainable practices, the sustainable use of common resources (freshwater) and encourages students to explore the equitable sharing of benefits gained from the use of this generic resource.\r\nThis paper presents qualitative evidence from research conducted into student perceptions’ of the effectiveness of SSG as a new way to learn and think about business sustainability.  It utilises the HEA Framework for Engagement through Partnership and the Framework for Engagement in Game-based Learning and Teaching to explore the value the Sustainable Strategies Game has for experiential and collaborative learning for Education for Sustainability and its ability to engage students in the complexities of integrating social, environmental and economic impacts of consuming natural resources within business operations. The findings suggest that the Sustainable Strategies Game provides an entertaining learning environment that challenges sustainability thinking and behaviours and encourages students to engage with the key principles of business sustainability and investigate business strategies that carry less impact on society and the environment.",
